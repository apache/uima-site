HOWTO build and publish the Site
================================

How do I change the site content and generate ?
---------------------------------------------

1) Make your modifications to the source xml file in xdocs/
  ** some generated content is generated from 
     source in the xdocs/stylesheets/project.xml
       edit this file to change the 
  **      left nav bar
  **      add downloads information
  
1.1) Do not put externally generated artifacts, like javadocs in xdocs/;
     put these directly into people.a.o: /x1/www/uima.apache.org/d/ 
     following the subdirectory conventions you see there.
  
1.2) Add trademark symbol to the first use of UIMA on a new page,
     by following it with &#0153;
      
2) Run the default ant target to generate new html

    $ ant

3) If errors, fix and repeat step 2

4) If all ok - you can verify by looking at the site locally 
   with your browser, do a svn commit to ensure that all changes
   both .xml in the xdocs directory and the .html in the docs 
   directory get committed.

How do I deploy site to the internet?
-------------------------------------

Deployment is done as soon as the SVN commit happens, because
the site is setup to use svnpubsub.

How do I handle images?
-----------------------
Design images in some tool that many committers may have access to.
Save the results of the design also as a .png or similar image
suitable for embedding.

Images and their original design source are stored under the docs/images/
folder, not in the xdocs/

How do I style the website?
---------------------------
Most of the styling is in docs/stylesheets/base.css
A bit of the styling is in xdocs/stylesheets/site.vsl

What is the dist/uima/META/uima.html file?
------------------------------------------
This is a file used by automatic signing-checking software, maintained by
Henk Penning.  
This file and its gpg signature .asc file (which must be signed by the PMC chairperson)
are uploaded to dist.apache.org/repos/dist/uima/META (neither the dev nor the release subdirs)

Commit to https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/uima  as META and META.asc
