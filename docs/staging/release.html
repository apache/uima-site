		  At the beginning of the "UIMA Release Process" there must be consensus in the developer community

		  The result of this discussion should be published in a release plan to the UIMA wiki, if it is

      In a following step, you will extract from Jira the set of issues fixed in this release.
      To make that work, go through the Jiras and insure the ones you are including in the release
      are closed, and that the "Fixed in release xxx" is set for each Jira issue that is part of the
      release.
    </p>
                                                <p>
      There is a saved "filter" you can adjust for this that will display all fixed Jira issues with no Fixed in release xxx
      assigned.  You can go through subsets of this (use the filter to pick the subset you want)
      and do "bulk Jira changes" to update multiples of these in parallel, if that makes sense.

          mvn versions:display-plugin-updates and<br />
          mvn versions:display-property-updates</code><br /><br />
          Use this information to update to later versions, if appropriate.</li>
		    <li>
		      Make sure that each release artifact that should be released has the correct version number.
          These are normally updated automatically when the previous release is done.
          <!--
          There is an ant build script you can run here: <code>uimaj-distr/src/main/build/changeVersion.xml</code>.
          To run it, first edit the file versions.properties in the same ... / build directory, setting 
          the "previous" version (the current version info in the source), and the "new" version that it 
          should be set to.  Then, <code>cd</code>
          to <code>uimaj-distr/src/main/build</code> and do <code>ant changeVersion.xml</code> to run it. 
          It checks the following places for correct versions.
		      <ul>
			      <li>uimaj project: POM.xml</li>
			      <li>uimaj child projects: check version for the parent POM</li>

          Some of these things it doesn't update (if the update is complicated); in these case,

		      Make sure that any README files have been updated with the latest release information

		      Update both versions (text and HTML) of the release notes for the release.
		       JIRA can provide a list of 
		      issues for a certain release when using the 'ReleaseNotes' function, 
          after you've closed the Jira issues to be released with this version.
		    </li>
		    <li>Edit the POM of the top level thing being released, to add the property:
		    <pre>&lt;jiraVersion&gt;123456&lt;/jiraVersion&gt;</pre>
		    replacing the 123456 with the actual Jira internal version number 
		        (or numbers, separated by a comma) for the Jira release(s) being
		        done.  This value is used during release processing to automatically 
		        generate a report of the list of Jira issues that are included in this release.
		        Change "123456" to be the actual jira internal version number, which you can get 
            from the Jira url (see parameter fixfor=xxxxxx or fixforversion=xxxxxx) 
            by going to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA 
            and selecting "Releases" or "Versions" and then going to the 
            particular version and looking in the url for
            that version.
          <p>
		        You can also generate this report manually (for instance, if you want to
		        have a look at what it will produce) by going to top level project
		        being released (e.g., uimaj-distr) and issuing the maven command:
		        <pre>mvn changes:jira-report -N </pre></p>
		        
		         <p>Each time this plugin is run, it creates an updated report in the
		            top level of this project.  This report doesn't need to be checked into SVN.
		            It will be copied into the distribution archives (source and binary)
		            for this release.  The RELEASE_NOTES.html files have been updated to
		            refer to this generated report.</p>
		         <p>Running the mvn release... command will cause this report to be generated or
		            updated, every time the command is run.  So it is important that the POM 
		            is updated to include the internal Jira version number, so the 
		            right report is generated.</p>
		         <p>If you know the report is already generated, and want to skip the part of the
		            release which generates it, include -Dmaven.jiraReport.skip in your commandline.</p>
		        </li>
        <li>
          Do a trial build of the release candidate:
          <pre>cd **directory for creating the distribution** e.g. uimaj-distr
mvn install</pre>
        </li>
		  </ul>
		</p>

      We use the maven-release-plugin to do the releasing.  In the prepare phase, it updates the
      trunk artifacts to remove the -SNAPSHOT suffix, commits it to trunk, and then does an
      SVN copy of the trunk to create the tag.  Then it updates the trunk artifacts to the next
      version-SNAPSHOT, and commits that.
    </p>
                                                <p>The release:perform checks out the tag and builds/tests/installs and deploys it to the 
      NEXUS staging repository.
    </p>
                                                <p>During this process, the release plugin asks what the next levels should be and what the tag name 
        should be, and unless there's a good reason, we take the defaults (by just hitting enter).
    </p>
                                                <p>The release plugin automatically signs everything that needs signing using gpg.  It also
      builds the sources.jar, and the source-release.zip file, which can be later obtained and 
      should be a copy of the SVN tag for that artifact, and once unzipped, should be buildable,
      using <code>mvn install</code>.
    </p>
                                                <p>You can upload to the Nexus Staging repository several independent artifacts; they will
        all get added to the same unique temporary staging repository Nexus creates.  Once all the
        artifacts are in place, you log into 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://repository.apache.org">https://repository.apache.org</a> using your 
          LDAP credentials, go to your staging repository, and "close" the repository.  After that,
          nothing more can be added.  If you deploy another artifact, it will create a new 
          staging repository.</p>
                                                <p>If you have several artifacts to release, and you want subsequent artifacts to 
        depend on the released versions of earlier ones, you can do this, by releasing the 
        first one, then releasing subsequent ones that depend on that, etc.  This works because
        the first one you release will get built with the release version and installed to your
        local repository, as well as the Nexus staging repository.  So subsequent ones that depend on
        the release version of previous ones, will find that in your local repository.  
        </p>
                                                <p>
          If you forget something and close the staging repository too soon, just continue as if you hadn't.
          Subsequent release artifacts will go into another newly created staging spot on Nexus.

      POMs can refer to other artifacts in several ways, for example via the &lt;parent-pom&gt;
      element, or via a &lt;dependency&gt; element.  References in these two elements are automatically updated
      during the release process, from xx-SNAPSHOT to xx for the tag, and then to the next development level,
      for the trunk.  So, no manual maintenance of these is needed; let the release plugin do this work.

      After things are staged, you write a note to the dev list, asking for an approval vote.
      You need to provide the url(s) of the closed staging repository in the note so the approvers
      can find the code to check.  The [VOTE] email should be based on similar previous votes, and
      include instructions to testers on how to set up their maven settings.xml file to specify
      the particular staging repository (or repositories, if more than one is being used).
      For an example, see <a href="http://markmail.org/message/4ae7zb4ucmivlkaa">this dev-list post</a>.
