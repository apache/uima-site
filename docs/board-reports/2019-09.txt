Board report for Apache UIMA, for September 2019.

Apache UIMA's mission: the creation and maintenance of open-source software
related to the analysis of unstructured data, guided by the UIMA Oasis

facilitating the analysis of unstructured content such as text, audio and 
video.

## Board question from last report: druggeri:  
>> It's good to see new contributors. 
>> Any prospects for new PMC members... it's been a while.

We do not currently have any new PMC member prospects, 
but we keep our eye out for some.

Activity:
  After the release of uimaj, we started the work to migrate 
  that project from SVN to GIT.
  This has been a slow and difficult process,   
  due mainly to a couple of things  
  
  1) the documentation for GIT at apache 
     leaves several things undocumented, and also includes 
     apparently out-of-date information.
     See for example, 
     https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/LEGAL/issues/LEGAL-478
     (read the comments) 
     
  2) simple modifications for one's project's GIT repository 
     such as renaming a branch, sometimes require filing of 
     INFRA Jira issues, and due to current load, 
     these appear in their KANBAN queue that's 100's of items long.
     See https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/INFRA, and
     choose the KANBAN view on the left-hand navigation.
     The result is that with the current INFRA staffing resources,
     it can take more than a week to get these acted on.
  
Community Health: The community continues to be moderately active; 
some new contributors doing patches.

Issues: No Board level issues at this time.
