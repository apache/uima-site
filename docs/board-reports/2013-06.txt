Board report for Apache UIMA, for March 2013.

Apache UIMA's mission: the creation and maintenance of open-source
software related to the analysis of unstructured data, guided by the
UIMA Oasis Standard.

Releases: 
We released a component, Apache UIMA Ruta r 2.0.2, on 29 May 2013
http://uima.apache.org/news.html#29

Other Activity:
Following the advice of trademarks@, the trademark issue over the
name "Textmarker" was resolved by us dropping the use of that 
term, and renaming the project UIMA Ruta, and doing a new release 
under that name, updating the Website, etc.

All three new major recent contributions, uimaFIT, Ruta, and DUCC,
are very active.  

Community:
Ruta is getting additional contributions from 
4 new people in that community (who have sent in ICLAs).
 
Issues: 
No Board level issues at this time.
