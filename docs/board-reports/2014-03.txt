Other Activity:

Worked with Infra to set up a demo web-server for DUCC
here:  http://uima-ducc-vm.apache.org:42133/jobs.jsp

The main web page was augmented to reflect the growning
number of significant components: Ruta, DUCC, and uimaFIT
were added to the big picture.

Major work continues on DUCC and Ruta. The core Java
framework is being improved to better support large
multi-core processors.

The mailing lists are fairly active, and normal
bug finding/fixing work continues.
