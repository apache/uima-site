Attachment AK: Status report for the Apache UIMA Project

Apache UIMA's mission: the creation and maintenance of open-source
software related to the analysis of unstructured data, guided by the
UIMA Oasis Standard.

Moving to TLP
-------------
In the last month, we completed our move to a TLP, and are almost finished
with the updates needed for making use of a major redesign of how we use Maven 
to do our builds and releases that uses the standard Apache Maven Parent POM 
and the Apache Nexus repository installation.  

The website was updated to remove "incubator" things, including some graphics.

Releases
--------
none yet (as a TLP), we hope to do one in the next month or 2.

2010-1-26 2.3.0 (Incubator - last release) release of Java SDK, Annotator 
                add-on package, UIMA-AS (Async scaleout), and UIMA-CPP 
                (C++ enablement)

Development
-----------
Lots of work in devising a new way to use Maven that is much more aligned
with the conventional way of doing things.  

We still have a significant number of issues remain in Jira, postponed from the
last release.  More progress should get made on these after our Maven re-alignment
work is finished.

Some issues regarding large scale use of UIMA-AS were reported and fixed.
