UIMA AS is in the process of switching to GIT.

Issues at a slow/moderate pace are continuing to be reported 
and fixed in core UIMA, uimaFIT, Ruta, uima-as, and uima-ducc.
Activity seems to have picked up a bit during the Covid-19
period, perhaps because people have a bit more time at home to
work on things.
