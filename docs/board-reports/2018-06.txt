    We investigated GDPR impacts on our website, and decided to be prudent and
    removed our Google Analytics which we were not using very much, and
    changed our Twitter "widget" (which seemed to store / send various user
    -related data) to a plain link.

    This latter change was unfortunate, as the widget use to display recent
    tweets. It would be good if Apache figures out a global
    "it's-ok-to-do-this" set of policies/best practices for this.
