## Project Activity:
- uima-uimaj-3.1.1 was released on 2022-10-31
- focus is currently to improve compatibility of the UIMA Java SDK
 and uimaFIT with multi-classloader such as OSGI
- retirement of the UIMA DUCC subproject has been voted positively
- retirement of all v2.x versions of UIMA subprojects has been voted positively.
  This would also affect e.g. the UIMA-AS subproject, sandbox components, etc.
  of which currently no v3 versions exist.
- voting for retirement of the UIMA C++ SDK is suspended. One community member
  has suggested to take over maintenance of the subproject and asked for
  a month of time to consider.
- the UIMA Java SDK, uimaFIT and UIMA Ruta subprojects continue being active.
  New releases are tentatively scheduled for Q1 2023.

## Community Health:
The community remains moderately active. Eventually, I was able to work on
upgrading the non-ASF ClearTK OSS project to UIMAv3 myself. A release will
probably follow in Q1 2023 and that may pave the way for e.g. Apache cTAKES
to also finally upgrade to UIMAv3.
