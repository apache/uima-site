## Description:
Apache UIMA's mission: the creation and maintenance of open-source software
related to the analysis of unstructured data, guided by the UIMA Oasis
Standard. The software provides frameworks, tools and annotators,
facilitating the analysis of unstructured content such as text, audio and
video.

## Issues:
No Board level issues at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache UIMA was founded 2010-03-17 (12 years ago)
There are currently 25 committers and 17 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Viorel Morari on 2019-11-19.
- No new committers. Last addition was Viorel Morari on 2018-09-20.

## Project Activity:
No releases in this reporting period. Due to incoming bug reports several
sub-project releases have been delayed. UIMA Java SDK 3.2.1 will likely
not be released, instead we go for UIMA Java SDK 3.3.0. The new JSON format
requires some more time to mature, so it was extracted into its own GitHub
repo and will be released as a sub-zero version with the next release train.

## Community Health:
The community continues to be moderately active if we also count in 
questions on Stack Overflow and activity happening in the wider UIMA
eco-system (i.e. UIMA-related projects and projects using Apache UIMA). 
Communication around the core UIMA project is unfortunately pretty low
at the moment.
