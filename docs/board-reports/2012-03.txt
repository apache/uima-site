Board report for Apache UIMA, for March 2012.

Apache UIMA's mission: the creation and maintenance of open-source
software related to the analysis of unstructured data, guided by the
UIMA Oasis Standard.

Releases:
No releases since last report, but had 4 release candidates for the
C++ version of the UIMA framework, and it's pretty close to a release.
UIMA-AS (Asynchronous Scaleout) is being worked on for release.

Activity:
Typical mailing list activities for this quarter.  We did notice that
the approximate downloads (as reported here: 
http://people.apache.org/~vgritsenko/stats/projects/uima.html#Downloads-N1008F)
seems to have doubled in the last 2 quarters.   

Community:
We added Peter Klügl to the PMC.
