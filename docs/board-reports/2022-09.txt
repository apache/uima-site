## Community Health:
The community remains moderately active. Little feedback from the user side,
more activity on the developer side. There were attempts in bootstrapping 
contributions to the non-Apache (but UIMA-based) ClearTK OSS project to update
this project to UIMAv3 and thereby also contribute to unblocking the switch of 
Apache cTAKES to UIMAv3 - a bit of progress has been made here...
