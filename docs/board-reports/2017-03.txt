Community:

  Response to board question:
    idf: No new committer for over a year - any candidates?
    We did reach out in one project to see if a contributor
    might be interested, but got a not-at-this-time response.
    
    We are watching some other people who have started with 
    some initial contributions.
     
  The community continues to be moderately active.
  
  Actively working on boosting prioritization for work on
  UIMA CPP; this (sub)project has had pending fixes that haven't been
  applied and needs a new release.  
 
Issues:
No Board level issues at this time.
