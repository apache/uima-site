Board report for Apache UIMA, for June 2012.

Apache UIMA's mission: the creation and maintenance of open-source
software related to the analysis of unstructured data, guided by the
UIMA Oasis Standard.

Releases:
No releases since last report (except for some build tooling).

Activity:
Typical mailing list activities for this quarter. 
Bug fixes and improvements are actively being done to both
UIMA base SDK and UIMA-AS.  Work continues on the TextMarker project 
in the sandbox.  A new project has been added to the sandbox for 
UIMA components running on the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) 
programming model. We are considering a proposal to bring a 
contribution, uimaFIT, into the project.

We hope to have the next release in the next Quarter, of UIMA-AS (probably
based on a next release of UIMA SDK), and of UIMA-C++.
