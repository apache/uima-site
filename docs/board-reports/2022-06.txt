- uima-ruta and uimaj-io-json to follow soon

  enable more frequent releases (or at least less painful) in the future

## Community Health:
The community remains moderately active. Little feedback from the user side,
more activity on the developer side. It appears that other projects like
Apache cTAKES are stuck on UIMAv2 while the Apache UIMA project focusses on
the UIMAv3 line and does not plan further v2 releases. One reason they may be
stuck is a dependency on a no longer maintained third-party library (ClearTK)
which relies on UIMAv2. Not clear yet if, when and how users can be brought
onto UIMAv3.
