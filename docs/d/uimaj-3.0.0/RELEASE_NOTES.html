<h2><a id="what.is.uima">1. What is UIMA?</a></h2>

     <p>
  			Unstructured Information Management applications are
				software systems that analyze large volumes of
				unstructured information in order to discover knowledge
				that is relevant to an end user. UIMA is a framework and
				SDK for developing such applications. An example UIM
				application might ingest plain text and identify
				entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or
				relations, such as works-for or located-at. UIMA enables
				such an application to be decomposed into components,
				for example "language identification" -&gt; "language
				specific segmentation" -&gt; "sentence boundary
				detection" -&gt; "entity detection (person/place names
				etc.)". Each component must implement interfaces defined
				by the framework and must provide self-describing
				metadata via XML descriptor files. The framework manages
				these components and the data flow between them.
				Components are written in Java or C++; the data that
				flows between components is designed for efficient
				mapping between these languages. UIMA additionally
				provides capabilities to wrap components as network
				services, and can scale to very large volumes by
				replicating processing pipelines over a cluster of
				networked nodes.
			</p>
      <p>
				Apache UIMA is an Apache-licensed open source
				implementation of the UIMA specification (that
				specification is, in turn, being developed concurrently
				by a technical committee within
				<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org">OASIS</a>,
				a standards organization). We invite and encourage you
				to participate in both the implementation and
				specification efforts.
			</p>
      <p>
				UIMA is a component framework for analysing unstructured
				content such as text, audio and video. It comprises an
				SDK and tooling for composing and running analytic
				components written in Java and C++, with some support
				for Perl, Python and TCL.
			</p>

<h2><a id="major.changes">Major Changes in this Release</a></h2>

<p>Version 3 is a major reimplementation of the internals of 
the Java version of UIMA to support better integration with
Java 8, alignment with modern memory hierarchies for 
better performance, and multiple functional enhancements and
improvements.</p>
<p>
If non-built-in JCas cover classes are being used,
a one-time regeneration or migration step is required for these.  
Please read the Version 3 users guide located in the docs directory
for information on these changes and the migration tool which can
aid in migrating existing JCas class definitions.
</p>

<p>A very brief summary of Version 3:</p>
<ul><li>Feature Structures become Java Objects, 
subject to Garbage Collection, just like any other objects, 
when no longer reachable.</li>
<li>Iterating over indexes no longer throws 
ConcurrentModificationException.</li>
<li>Support for arbitrary Java Objects in the CAS, 
using special custom implementations of JCas cover classes for those.</li>
<li>Using the above new capability, new semi-built-ins for three new types: ArrayList style
lists of Feature Structures and ints, and an FSHashSet</li>
<li>New "select" framework for flexible 
access to Feature Structures, that can ignore typeOrdering keys in indexes.</li>
<li>Integration with Java 8 facilities such as Streams</li>
<li>Logging framework upgraded, supporting embedding UIMA in other frameworks using 
popular logging APIs</li>
<li>There are many performance improvements</li>
</ul>


<p>Please read the Version 3 users guide for more details.</p>

<p>Specific changes in this release versus the previous beta release include</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support of a v2 id compatibility mode, for backwards compatibility, enables use of the LowLevelCAS API getFSForRef(int)
  <li>Improved support for sharing a set of loaded JCas classes with different, but somewhat compatible type systems
  <li>New semi-builtin types: a FSLinkedHashSet, and a map from "int"s to Feature Structures
</ul>
 
<h3>API changes</h3>
 <p>There is an API compatibility report covering the non-internal APIs;
   see <a href="api-change-report.html">change report</a> for the list of API changes
   since version 2.10.2.
