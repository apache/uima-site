<h2><a id="what.is.uima">1. What is UIMA?</a></h2>

     <p>
  			Unstructured Information Management applications are
				software systems that analyze large volumes of
				unstructured information in order to discover knowledge
				that is relevant to an end user. UIMA is a framework and
				SDK for developing such applications. An example UIM
				application might ingest plain text and identify
				entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or
				relations, such as works-for or located-at. UIMA enables
				such an application to be decomposed into components,
				for example "language identification" -&gt; "language
				specific segmentation" -&gt; "sentence boundary
				detection" -&gt; "entity detection (person/place names
				etc.)". Each component must implement interfaces defined
				by the framework and must provide self-describing
				metadata via XML descriptor files. The framework manages
				these components and the data flow between them.
				Components are written in Java or C++; the data that
				flows between components is designed for efficient
				mapping between these languages. UIMA additionally
				provides capabilities to wrap components as network
				services, and can scale to very large volumes by
				replicating processing pipelines over a cluster of
				networked nodes.
			</p>
      <p>
				Apache UIMA is an Apache-licensed open source
				implementation of the UIMA specification (that
				specification is, in turn, being developed concurrently
				by a technical committee within
				<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org">OASIS</a>,
				a standards organization). We invite and encourage you
				to participate in both the implementation and
				specification efforts.
			</p>
      <p>
				UIMA is a component framework for analysing unstructured
				content such as text, audio and video. It comprises an
				SDK and tooling for composing and running analytic
				components written in Java and C++, with some support
				for Perl, Python and TCL.
			</p>

<h2><a id="major.changes">Major Changes in this Release</a></h2>

<h3>Java 7 minimum level</h3>
<p>Java 7 is now the minimum level of Java required.</p>

<h3>Several JVM properties support backwards compatibility</h3>
<p>See the README and <a target="_blank" href="http://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-2.7.0/references.html#ugr.ref.config">
the Reference chapter</a> for a description of these.

<h3>JSON serialization support</h3>
<p>
 JSON serialization support is added for Type System Descriptions, and for CASs.
  Several formats for JSON CAS serialization are provided, please see the chapter in the
  UIMA reference documentation for details.
</p>

<h3>Sorted and Bag indexes no longer store multiple instances of identical FSs</h3>
<p>
The meaning of "bag" and "sorted" index has been made consistent with how these are handled
when sending CASes to remote services.  This means that adding the same identical FS to the
indexes, multiple times, will no longer add duplicate index entries.  And, removing a FS from an index
is guaranteed that that particular FS will no longer be in any index.  (Before, if you had 
added a particular FS to a sorted or bag index, multiple times, the remove behavior would
remove just one of the instances).  Deserialization of CASes sent to remote services has never 
added Feature Structures to the index multiple times, so this change makes that behavior 
consistent. For more details, see <a target="_blank" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-3399">
Jira issue UIMA-3399</a>.
</p>

<p>Because some users may need the previous behavior that permitted duplicates of identical Feature Structures in
the sorted and bag indexes. this change can be disabled, by running the JVM with the defined property
"uima.allow_duplicate_add_to_indexes".</p>


<h3>Index corruption avoidance</h3>
<p>To prevent potential index corruption, UIMA now recovers (unless disabled by 
   <code>"-Duima.disable_auto_protect_indexes"</code>) 
  from illegal modifications of features.</p>
  
  <p>These are modifications to features used as index keys, done while the Feature Structure 
  being modified is currently in one or more indexes (see
  <a target="_blank" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-4135">Jira issue UIMA-4135</a>).</p>
  
  <p>Corruption is prevented by first removing the feature structure being updated, 
  then doing the update, and then adding the feature structure back to the indexes.
  Because these actions can affect performance, it is recommended that you run with JVM property
  "-Duima.report_fs_update_corrupts_index" in order to see if any user code has this problem, and fix these via 
  redesign, or by wrapping the affected areas with a form of <code>protectIndexes()</code>, which does the
  needed removes and add-backs under your control, so you can do several feature updates at once,
  before adding the feature structure back.  <code>protectIndexes</code> is described in the
  <a target="_blank" href=
  "http://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-2.7.0/references.html#ugr.ref.cas.updating_indexed_feature_structures">
  CAS Reference Chapter</a> and the CAS Javadocs; you can also use it with the JCas.</p>
  
  <p>Because this protection is automatic and hidden, if you are iterating over sorted or set indexes, the
  automatic recovery may cause unexpected ConcurrentModificationExceptions to be thrown by the iterator when
  advancing. To work around this, either stop modifying features which are used as keys in the index being iterated over,
  or use Snapshot iterators (see following).</p>

<h3>New Snapshot iterators won't throw ConcurrentModificationException</h3>
<p>A long-standing difficulty with Feature Structure iterators, namely, that adding to / removing from the underlying
  index being iterated over is not allowed while iterating (unless you use a moveToXXX kind of operation to "reset" the
  iterator), is addressed with a new class of "snapshot" iterators.
  These take a snapshot of the state of the index when the iterator is created; subsequent modifications to the index
  are then permitted, while the iterator continues to iterate over the snapshot it created; these iterators do not
  throw ConcurrentModificationException.  The implementation of this feature is via a new method on FSIndex, 
  <a target="_blank" href=
  "http://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-2.7.0/apidocs/org/apache/uima/cas/FSIndex.html#withSnapshotIterators--">
  withSnapshotIterators()</a>, which 
  creates a light-weight copy of the the FSIndex instance whose iterator method iterators gets the Snapshot kind.  
  This approach allows using the new index in Java's "extended for" statement.</p>
  
  <p>The current implementation of the snapshot iterators makes a snapshot of the index being iterated over, at
  creation time, which has a cost in space and time.</p>

<h3>Other changes</h3>
<p>Some of the other major changes are listed here; for the complete list, see <a href="issuesFixed/jira-report.html">
the Issues Fixed report</a>.</p> 
<ul><li> making the JCasGen Eclipse plugin work with more varieties of specifications for class paths.
 Jira issues: UIMA-<a target="_blank" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-4080">4080</a>/
 <a target="_blank" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-4081">4081</a></li>
 
 <li>moveTo(a_Feature_Structure) or creating a new iterator to start at a feature sometimes went to the wrong place. 
 Jira issues: <a target="_blank" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-4094">UIMA-4094</a> 
 and <a target="_blank" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-4105">UIMA-4105</a>.</li>
 
 <li>deserialization of deltaCAS when modifying existing indexed Feature Structures could corrupt the indexes. 
 Jira issue: <a target="_blank" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-4100">UIMA-4100</a>.</li>
 
 <li>default bag indexes will now be created if there are only Set indexes. 
 Jira issue: <a target="_blank" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-4111">UIMA-4111</a>.</li>
 
 <li><p>Xmi CAS Serialization now checks to see that list and array feature values marked as multipleReferencesAllowed=false
 (or not marked at all, which defaults to multipleReferencesAllowed=false) are not multiply-referenced.  If they are,
 they continue to be serialized as if they are independent objects (as was previously done), but now a new 
 warning message is issued.  Because there can be a huge number of these messages, they are automatically
 throttled down, to prevent running out of room in the error logs.</p>
 <p>The message strings for these look like "Feature [some-feature-name] is marked multipleReferencesAllowed=false,
 but it has multiple references.  These will be serialized in duplicate."</p></li>
 
 <li>The CasCopier now checks to insure that the range type of the target feature has the same name as the 
 range type of the source feature, which catches errors when two different type systems are used for the source and
 target.  For example, this now prevents a feature with range type "uima.cas.Float" from being copied 
 into one with range type "uima.cas.String".
 </li>
 </ul>
 
 <h3>Performance change highlights</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>Iterators obtained for Bag indexes and from the method getAllIndexedFS( ... type ... ) are 
 by definition, unordered.  The implementation for these iterators is now  
 much faster, taking advantage of the unordered aspect of these things and returning items in a more 
 efficient sequence.
 Jira issue: <a target="_blank" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-4166">UIMA-4166</a>.</li>
 <li>CasCopier has been reimplemented and is approximately 5-10 times faster.</li>
 </ul>
