              Apache Distributed UIMA Cluster Computing (DUCC) Version 2.2.0 README
              

1. Building from the Source Distribution
========================================
     
We use Maven 3.0 for building; download this if needed, 
and set the environment variable MAVEN_OPTS to -Xmx800m -XX:MaxPermSize-256m.
To build UIMA-DUCC, install Java SDK 7.

Then build from the directory containing this README by issuing the command
   mvn clean install.
   
This builds everything except the source-release.zip file and DUCC documentation. 
To build the documentation make sure you have LATEX installed and set the
environment variable BUILD_DUCCDOCS=true, or activate the build-duccdocs profile with:

   mvn clean install -Pbuild-duccdocs

To build everything including the source-release.zip and documentation, use:

   mvn clean install -Papache-release,build-duccdocs
   
To setup GPG signing see http://uima.apache.org/one-time-release-setup.html
   
Look for the result in the two artifacts: 
   target/uima-ducc-[version]-source-release.zip (if run with -Papache-release) and
   target/uima-ducc-[version]-bin.tar.gz
