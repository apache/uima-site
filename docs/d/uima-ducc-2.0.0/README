              Apache Distributed UIMA Cluster Computing (DUCC) Version 2.0.0 README
              

1. Building from the Source Distribution
========================================
     
We use Maven 3.0 for building; download this if needed, 
and set the environment variable MAVEN_OPTS to -Xmx800m -XX:MaxPermSize-256m.

To build UIMA-DUCC, install Java SDK 7.

Then build from the directory containing this README by issuing the command
   mvn clean install.
   
This builds everything except the ...source-release.zip file and DUCC documentation. 
To build documentation make sure you have LATEX installed and change the command to:

   mvn clean install -Pbuild-duccdocs

To build everything including the ...source-release.zip, change the command to 

   mvn clean install -Papache-release
   
The above also builds DUCC documentation.   
   
Look for the result in the two artifacts: 
   target/uima-ducc-[version]-source-release.zip (if run with -Papache-release) and
   target/uima-ducc-[version]-bin.tar.gz
