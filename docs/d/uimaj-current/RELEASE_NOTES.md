## <a id="what.is.uima">What is UIMA?</a>

Unstructured Information Management applications are software systems that analyze large volumes of
unstructured information in order to discover knowledge that is relevant to an end user. UIMA is a
framework and SDK for developing such applications. An example UIM application might ingest plain
text and identify entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or relations, such as works-for
or located-at. UIMA enables such an application to be decomposed into components, for example
"language identification" -> "language specific segmentation" -> "sentence boundary detection" ->
"entity detection (person/place names etc.)". Each component must implement interfaces defined by
the framework and must provide self-describing metadata via XML descriptor files. The framework
manages these components and the data flow between them. Components are written in Java or C++; the
data that flows between components is designed for efficient mapping between these languages. UIMA
additionally provides capabilities to wrap components as network services, and can scale to very
large volumes by replicating processing pipelines over a cluster of networked nodes.

Apache UIMA is an Apache-licensed open source implementation of the UIMA specification (that 
specification is, in turn, being developed concurrently by a technical committee within
[OASIS](http://www.oasis-open.org), a standards organization). We invite and encourage you to
participate in both the implementation and specification efforts.

UIMA is a component framework for analysing unstructured content such as text, audio and video. It
comprises an SDK and tooling for composing and running analytic components written in Java and C++,
with some support for Perl, Python and TCL.
