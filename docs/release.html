      To make this accurate, go through the Jiras and ensure the ones you are including in the release
      are closed/resolved, and that the "Fixed in release xxx" is set for each Jira issue that is part of the

      There is a saved "filter" you can adjust for this that will display all fixed Jira issues with no Fixed in release xxx
      assigned.  You can go through subsets of this (use the filter to pick the subset you want)
      and do "bulk Jira changes" to update multiples of these in parallel, if that makes sense.

          mvn versions:display-plugin-updates and<br />
          mvn versions:display-property-updates</code><br /><br />
          Use this information to update to later versions, if appropriate.</li>
		    <li>
		      Make sure that each release artifact that should be released has the correct version number.
          These are normally updated automatically when the previous release is done.
          <!--
          There is an ant build script you can run here: <code>uimaj-distr/src/main/build/changeVersion.xml</code>.
          To run it, first edit the file versions.properties in the same ... / build directory, setting 
          the "previous" version (the current version info in the source), and the "new" version that it 
          should be set to.  Then, <code>cd</code>
          to <code>uimaj-distr/src/main/build</code> and do <code>ant changeVersion.xml</code> to run it. 
          It checks the following places for correct versions.
		      <ul>
			      <li>uimaj project: POM.xml</li>
			      <li>uimaj child projects: check version for the parent POM</li>

          after you've closed the Jira issues to be released with this version. -->
		    </li>
		    <li>Edit the POM of the top level thing being released, to add the property:
		    <pre>&lt;jiraVersion&gt;123456&lt;/jiraVersion&gt;</pre>
		    replacing the 123456 with the actual Jira internal version number 
		        (or numbers, separated by a comma) for the Jira release(s) being
		        done.  This value is used during release processing to automatically 
		        generate a report of the list of Jira issues that are included in this release.
		        Change "123456" to be the actual jira internal version number, which you can get 
            from the Jira url (see parameter fixfor=xxxxxx or fixforversion=xxxxxx) 
            by going to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA 
            and selecting "Releases" or "Versions" and then going to the 
            particular version and looking in the url for
            that version.
          <p>
		        You can also generate this report manually (for instance, if you want to
		        have a look at what it will produce) by going to top level project
		        being released (e.g., uimaj-distr) and issuing the maven command:
		        <pre>mvn changes:jira-report -N </pre></p>
		        
		         <p>Each time this plugin is run, it creates an updated report in the
		            top level of this project.  This report doesn't need to be checked into SVN.
		            It will be regenerated and copied into the distribution archives (source and binary)
		            during a release.  The RELEASE_NOTES.html files have been updated to
		            refer to this generated report.</p>
		         <p>Running the mvn release... command will cause this report to be generated or
		            updated, every time the command is run.  So it is important that the POM 
		            is updated to include the internal Jira version number, so the 
		            right report is generated.</p>

      We use the maven-release-plugin to do the releasing.  In the prepare phase, it updates the
      trunk artifacts to remove the -SNAPSHOT suffix, commits it to trunk, and then does an
      SVN copy of the trunk to create the tag.  Then it updates the trunk artifacts to the next
      version-SNAPSHOT, and commits that.
    </p>
                                                <p>The release:perform checks out the tag and builds/tests/installs and deploys it to the 
      NEXUS staging repository.
    </p>
                                                <p>During this process, the release plugin asks what the next levels should be and what the tag name 
        should be, and unless there's a good reason, we take the defaults (by just hitting enter).
        The exception to this is in naming the SVN TAG - normally we have "release candidates".
        The recommended convention is to take the suggested name and add "-rc1" for release candidate 1,
        etc.
    </p>
                                                <p>The release plugin automatically signs everything that needs signing using gpg.  It also
      builds the sources.jar, and one overall (for multi-module projects) source-release.zip file, 
      which can be later obtained and 
      should be a copy of the SVN tag for that artifact, and once unzipped, should be buildable,
      using <code>mvn install</code>.
    </p>
                                                <p>Steps:
    <ul>
           <li>Make sure all changes are checked into SVN.  Then check out from SVN the project(s)
        you'll be building, into a new "build" location, and do all the building from there.</li>
        <li>Purge your local maven repository of artifacts being built by running in the 
        top level directory you'll be building from:
        <br /><br />
          <code>mvn dependency:purge-local-repository</code><br /><br />
          Note that this will immediately re-resolve the dependencies from the maven repositories
          you have configured. 
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Do a trial build of the release candidate:
          <pre>cd **directory for doing the release** 
mvn install -Papache-release</pre>
          <p>The <code>-Papache-release</code> is used to have the build mimic the 
             build actions that would be taken when the release plugin is running
             the release build.</p>
        </li>
        <li><code>mvn release:prepare -DautoVersionSubmodules</code>
        <ul><li>take the defaults for the questions, except add -rcN (e.g. -rc1) for the 
        name of the svn tag - to allow for multiple release candidates</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><code>mvn release:perform</code></li>
    </ul> 
    </p>
                                                <p>Normally, everything built is uploaded to the Apache's Nexus Staging repository.  However, for the 
    (large) distribution objects, such as the source and binary distributions for UIMA Java SDK etc.,
    the "deploy" step is skipped.  These artifacts, instead of being "distributed" using the
    Maven central repository, are distributed using the Apache Mirroring System.</p>
                                                <p>You can upload to the Nexus Staging repository several independent artifacts; they will
        all get added to the same unique temporary staging repository Nexus creates.  Once all the
        artifacts are in place, you log into 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://repository.apache.org">https://repository.apache.org</a> using your 
          LDAP credentials, go to your staging repository, and "close" the repository.  After that,
          nothing more can be added.  If you deploy another artifact, it will create a new 
          staging repository.</p>
                                                <p class="note"><b>If you forget to close the repo</b>, it will be open when you do your next 
    release candidate, and then you'll have in the repo both release candidates, (with
    later files overwriting newer), which if any file names have changed, will <b>create
    a mess.  So be sure to <code><b>close</b></code> (and <code><b>drop</b></code> as appropriate) any previous repo</b> before starting a release:perform for a new
    release candidate, so they deploy into a "fresh" empty staging repo.</p>
                                                <p>If you have several artifacts to release, and you want subsequent artifacts to 
        depend on the released versions of earlier ones, you can do this, by releasing the 
        first one, then releasing subsequent ones that depend on that, etc.  This works because
        the first one you release will get built with the release version and installed to your
        local repository, as well as the Nexus staging repository.  So subsequent ones that depend on
        the release version of previous ones, will find that in your local repository.  
        </p>
                                                <p>
          If you forget something and close the staging repository too soon, just continue as if you hadn't.
          Subsequent release artifacts will go into another newly created staging spot on Nexus.
          The downside of this is that you'll have to tell the "voters" about multiple staging repos.

      at "work", and then another part at "home", the IP address will be different, and 
      multiple staging repositories will be created. This is not a problem, usually, unless
      you are <i>updating</i> a release by redoing it, and are expecting the previous version
      to be overwritten.  In case it isn't, you can just use the Nexus command line interface
      to delete the old version from the "other" staging repo.

      POMs can refer to other artifacts in several ways, for example via the &lt;parent-pom&gt;
      element, or via a &lt;dependency&gt; element.  Often, a release will involve releasing together
      multiple modules (all at -SNAPSHOT levels) that refer to one another using these elements.
      When that happens, the references in these two elements are automatically updated
      during the release process, from xx-SNAPSHOT to xx for the tag, and then to the next development level,
      for the trunk.

                                                <p>
  Although we have a spot in the distribution SVN under dev/uima for all the artifacts to be released
  via the Apache mirror system, you probably should not use this for
  release candidates, unless you suspect there won't be many of these (or they're small).  This is because
  SVN retains forever all the files you put into it, so if we go through 8 release candidates, each having 
  several multi-megabyte zip/tar files, these will just waste space in SVN. 
  </p>
                                                <p>
  The alternative is to stage the release candidate in your personal people.apache.org/~[user-id] space, and
  let testers/voters pull it from there.
  </p>
                                                <p>If you do use the distribution SVN for the release candidates, 
  follow the 
  <a href="saving-svn-resources.html">saving-svn-space</a> tricks if reasonable. 
  Typically, for each release, we create a new directory for that, and place
  all files pertaining to that release underneath that directory.

  update sites, see <a href="eclipse-update-site.html">eclipse-update-site</a> page.

      The component being released, if it has Eclipse features, will have its own
      Eclipse update (sub) site, which should be built along with the normal build of 
      the entire component, as part of that component's release.
  </p>
                                                <p>
  In building that component's update site, you may need to edit/update the affected
  component's feature project(s), and the category.xml file in the update-site, before
  building it.  For releases, run the signEclipseUpdateSite.sh (on Windows - inside Cygwin)
  to sign the Jars.  (Optional:) There's also a verifySignsEclipseUpdateSite.sh you can run to verify
  the signing was successful.
  </p>
                                                <p>
  If a new Eclipse update site is being added to the composite, edit in the composite
  project (.../build/uima-eclipse-composite-update-site) the buildCompositeRepository.xml
  file to add the new update site.  If doing a release, run the signing script for the
  composite site too.  
  </p>
                                                <p>
  The actual creation of the update site is done in several steps, following
  the conventions to 
  <a href="saving-svn-resources.html">save SVN resources</a>.  First, SVN copy (if needed) 
  the existing released composite update site
  (from https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/uima/eclipse-update-site) to
  https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/uima/eclispe-update-site (the staging spot for releases).
  Next, check out the existing update site from the dev spot into a working directory
  Next, update the working directory with any changes, and then check it back in (to the /dev/... spot).
  Note that any JARs, Zips, Tars, tar.gz artifacts need to be signed.
  </p>
                                                <p>Test the result: using the extended composite repository in various versions of
          Eclipse, and verify it installs OK.
  </p>
                                                <p>
  If you changed the composite site, bump up the version of .../build/uima-eclipse-composite-site/pom.xml
  and commit project changes to the trunk, and tag it.
  The component's individual update sites should be built and tagged as part of that project's release.
  </p>

      The source and binary distributions are manually copied by the 
      release manager to the Apache distribution SVN in the dev/uima spot, 
      to make them available for review.  The Maven module artifacts
      are found in the Nexus staging repository, and are available once 
      the release manager "closes" the repository.
    </p>
                                                <p>
      After things are staged, you write a note to the dev list, asking for an approval vote.
      You need to provide the url(s) of the closed staging repository in the note so the approvers
      can find the code to check, the SVN tag corresponding to the release, and
      if needed, and the place in the distribution SVN where the source and binary
      distributions being proposed are found.  
      The [VOTE] email should be based on similar previous votes, and
      include instructions to testers on how to set up their maven settings.xml file to specify
      the particular staging repository (or repositories, if more than one is being used).
      For an example, see <a href="http://markmail.org/message/4ae7zb4ucmivlkaa">this dev-list post</a>.
