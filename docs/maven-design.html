                                    <p>When writing a new POM, it is best to start with an existing POM for a similar
    kind of project, and derive the new POM from that.  Some points:
    <ul>
      <li><p>POMs contain a <code>&lt;url&gt;</code> element, which is supposed to 
        point to the UIMA website page for this artifact (or the main UIMA page).  
        If a POM doesn't have this element, it will inherit one from its parent
        but Maven will assume (usually incorrectly in our case) 
        that the url is the parent url value followed by "/" and
        this POMs artifactId.</p>
        
        <p>So, If this does not correspond to how the website is set up,
        please specify the url that is correct for the new project.</p>
      </li>
      <li>The SCM connection is needed for doing releases - and needs to be accurate for this
        component.  The same defaulting is applied as above, which is incorrect for our
        flat layout, so each POM needs to have an explicit SCM element.</li>
      <li>The POM's "version" is stated literally, not via a "property", etc.  
        Maven 3 
        will complain if you use properties here, and the release mechanism for maven
        manipulates these values (removing SNAPSHOT, incrementing things, etc.)</li>
      <li>The POM's groupId is omitted if it's the same as the parent pom's
        (which is true for all of our projects except our top-most parent pom); 
        if omitted, it inherits from the parent.</li>
      <li>The packaging is omitted if it is "jar".</li>
      <li>In the <code>build</code> section, the <code>&lt;groupId&gt;</code> for 
      standard maven plugins is omitted.</li>

                                                <p>For each artifact, the release process may build additional artifacts, and
     attach them to the main one, so they will "go along with" the main artifact during 
     Maven deployment to repositories.  Some of these are:</p>
                                                <ul>
      <li>
        sources.jar - holds the source files - this is for IDEs that want to refer to the source
      </li>
      
      <li><p>
        source-release.zip. This is the same as the sources, but includes all other files 
        (such as the pom.xml) not under the /src
        directory, needed for building.  
        The intent is that this is the same as the SVN checked-in files, and once unzipped, this
        should be "buildable" by doing "mvn install", etc. in the unzipped directory.
        </p>
        <p><code>source-release.zip</code> files for multi-project aggregates (such as the main
        UIMA SDK) are not "attached", and are not uploaded to maven for distribution; instead, 
        these are considered the main binary artifacts for the project and are distributed
        using Apache's own mirroring distribution system.

                                                <p>
    The release process happens when the commands <code>mvn release:prepare</code> followed by 
    <code>mvn release:perform</code> are executed.  The release plugin is set up by the common
    Apache parent Pom to specify the <code>apache-release</code> profile.  It is this profile
    being selected that causes (among many other things) the sources.jar and 
    source-release.zip artifacts to be built.
    You can debug this process without doing a release, by adding the parameter 
    <code>-Papache-release</code> to the non-release Maven build commands.

    of distributions:
    <ul>
      <li>Releases
      <ul>
        <li>source-release.zip files</li>
        <li>binary (built) packagings

              <ul>
                <li>Multi-project assemblies, like our main UIMA SDK</li>
                <li>Single-project assemblies, like our individual add-on projects</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>uploaded to main Maven Repository as part of releasing:
              <ul>
                <li>Individual Jars</li>
                <li>PEAR packages of some individual projects</li>

      <li>Eclipse Features
        <ul>
          <li>Features have their own special Eclipse-style form for licenses</li>
          <li>Boilerplate for these are kept in a common spot in the uima-build-resources project,
          in the subdirectory: licenses-eclipse-plugs-features.  
          There are two files here.  One is the boilerplate license, in 
          uima-eclipse-user-agreement.html (a text copy is also embedded in the features.properties).
          The second file is a boilerplate features.properties.</li>
          <li>Both of these files should be copied to the top level of feature project(s), and
          the feature.properties should be edited to have the right values for the particular feature.</li>

  </p>
                                                <h3>Three kinds of LICENSE/NOTICE files</h3>
                                                <p>There are typically three versions of these files, corresponding to source (only)
  distributions, other distributions which include "dependent" artifacts, which
  may have their own separate license and notice information, and a special one for 
  Eclipse Features.  The source (only) 
  versions of these files are in SVN at the top level of various project hierarchies.
  </p>
                                                <p class="Note">For some packagings of source artifacts, such as JARs for 
  projects that are part of bigger assemblies, the projects do not contain individual
  license and notice files (see for instance, <code>.../uimaj/trunk/uimaj-core</code>.
  For these, a standard LICENSE and NOTICE is computed using a template, augmented
  if needed by additions from the project's <code>pom</code>.</p>
                                                <p>All major releasable things (other than projects for Jars which are always released
  as part of an assembly - such as the Jars which make up the UIMA SDK), have top
  level license and notice files in their top most project; these are for the 
  source, only, and do not cover the dependencies (if any) that might be included with
  a binary-style release.
  </p>
                                                <p>Many of our packagings include dependencies, including OSGi and PEAR packagings, 
  as well as normal <code>binary</code> assemblies.
  The license and notice for these packagings is made by merging the license and notice
  files from the source artifact plus those from all the dependent artifacts 
  (removing duplications).</p>
                                                <h2>Standard Artifacts</h2>
                                                <p>The release process includes standard boiler-plate things in standard places.  
     The Maven remote-resources-plugin is used to get these resources from a special 
     UIMA build artifact (uima-build-resources), and customizes them for the particular project:
     <ul><li>The DEPENDENCIES file is generated from the 
     transitive closure of the dependencies in the POM.</li>
         <li>The NOTICES file is sometimes augmented with additional text 
         (we use this to add the IBM Copyright formerly
         in the files, per the Apache practice for moving these to the NOTICE file). 
         </li></ul>    
  </p>
                                                <p>These resources, after customization, are placed in the project's 
     target/maven-shared-archive-resources/META-INF/
     directory.  Later steps in the build use this directory for two purposes:
     <ul><li>adding this information to any JAR that might be built</li>
         <li>adding this information as part of generated assemblies - these files are copied to the top
             level (above any project).</li>
     </ul>
   </p>
                                                <p>
     The remote-resources-plugin adds a &lt;resource&gt; entry to the maven in-memory model &lt;resources&gt;
     element that specifies that the files in target/maven-shared-archive-resources/ be copied to
     target/classes.  (You can see this by running a mvn package step with the -X parameter.)
     This is what the remote-resources documentation means when it says:  
     "... the resources are injected into the current (in-memory) Maven project, 
     making them available to the process-resources phase."
   </p>
                                                <p><b><u>Overriding on a per-project basis:</u></b> 
      Files that the remote-resources-plugin obtains and places
      in the target/maven-shared-archive-resources/META-INF/ directory can be overridden
      by identically named files at the top level of the project.
      </p>
                                                <p>Note that there are two sets of LICENSE / NOTICE files for distributable entities - 
      one for the source distribution,
      and one for the binary distribution.  This is because the source distribution rarely needs other
      than the standard LICENSE/NOTICE files because it is 
      (usually) only distributing Apache-authored source; while the
      binary distribution often distributes additional components that are licensed under other
      licenses, with perhaps additional NOTICE requirements - in which case, the LICENSE and NOTICE files 
      contains all of the required licenses and notices for everything
      being distributed.</p>
                                                <p style="margin-left: 3em">
     For <code>binary</code> distributions, the LICENSE and NOTICE files 
     are taken from src/main/readme/ directory.
   </p>
                                                <p class="note">
     Some addon projects have just a single instance of LICENSE and NOTICE at the top level. 
     In this case, these are used for both the source and binary distribution, and they
     therefore need to cover everything distributed with the binary distribution (even
     if these are not delivered with the source distribution).
   </p>
                                                <h2>Eclipse Features and Plugins</h2>
                                                <p>The license and notice section for Eclipse plugins follows the conventions used for
    other Jars.  For Eclipse Features, there is a boilerplate license used for all Features, which, in turn, refers to specific
    other embedded Licenses and Notices.  The boilerplate becomes part of the Feature jar.
    </p>
                                                <p>When setting up a new Eclipse Feature, developers need to manually copy the latest boilerplate 
    features.properties and uima-eclipse-user-agreement.html files from the uima-build-resources project 
    into their feature project top-level directory.
    They need to then modify the values of the following properties for their feature:
    <ul><li>featureName</li><li>description</li></ul>
    </p>
                                                <p>The build adds these files to the resource set when building the jar.

    The UIMA Project, in addition to the main frameworks (the UIMA SDK and the UIMA-AS addon), 
    has Annotators and other components and tools 
    (such as the SimpleServer) that it releases.  These in the past have been released as a big
    assembly we called the Addons or Sandbox, but now are are being supported also as individual items.
  </p>
                                                <p>
    Two kinds of packaging for these are available, chosen by specifying one of the following parent-poms:
    <ul><li>parent-pom-annotator - this packages things as a PEAR</li>
      <li>parent-pom-single-project - this packages things as a tar / zip file having a lib/ directory
        with the generated Jar and dependencies (see below).</li></ul>
  </p>
                                                <p>
    The individual Annotators are mostly packaged as 
    <a href="d/uimaj-current/references/references.html#ugr.ref.pear">
      PEAR</a> files, which are the UIMA standard for annotator component packaging and distribution.
    The Pear is generated using the PearPackagingMavenPlugin, which generates automatically a
    conventional Pear Installation Descriptor, from the information in the project.    
    The PEAR artifact is generated in addition to Jar of the code, and includes
    other items such as the generated documentation, data, and a lib/ directory with other Jars
    needed for the PEAR to operate.  This PEAR is the packaged equivalent of a binary distribution
    artifact produced for the main framework, and comes with a license and notice that
    covers any included libraries.  Generated PEARs are included in the artifacts that are managed by
    Maven, and are available in the Maven repository system.
  </p>
                                                <p class="note">
    The PEAR internal folder "src" is not used by components here; the source is instead available 
    via the standard Maven source directory conventions.
  </p>
                                                <p>
    PEARs must have a "main" descriptor, which is the one normally used to configure and run 
    the annotator.  When using the parent-pom-annotator to indicate PEAR packaging, 
    you must include a property called <code>
    &lt;pearMainDescriptor&gt;</code> in the Annotator's POM, 
    whose value is the path from the project base directory
    identifying the main descriptor.  For example, if the folder "desc" was at the root of your project, the 
    value might be something like "desc/my-main-descriptor.xml".
  </p>
                                                <p>If an annotator isn't suitable for PEAR packaging, perhaps because it is inappropriate to have 
    one pre-done main descriptor, then the annotator can be packaged as a single-project, instead, by 
    marking the POM's parent parent-pom-single-project.</p>

                                                <p>Use these conventions to get your annotator properly packaged when you use the parent-pom-annotator or 
    the parent-pom-single-project as your parent pom:
    <ul>
      <li>Use &lt;package&gt;jar&lt;/package&gt; (which is the default, so it should be omitted), if there
        is a Jar that should be built (as is usually the case).  This will cause the main
       annotator Jar to be built, including any resources (plus the top-level desc folder, if it exists), 
       as normal.</li>
      <li>Create the required License, Notice, and optional Readme, and Release Notes files 
        in the project directory at the top level; these will be included in the
        PEAR or simple project binary assembly at the top level.  
        The License and Notice files should be for the entire project, including
        all third-party Jars etc. being distributed.
        <p style="margin-left: 2em">The generated Jar, which only has Apache-developed code, 
          will have the normal Apache License and Notice files.</p></li>
      <li>Dependencies: those marked with scope "compile" (the default) or "runtime"
        are copied to the PEAR or single-project's lib/ directory.  To keep a dependency needed for compiling
        from being included in the lib/, give it a scope of "provided".
        <p class="note">You may use the dependencies <code>&lt;exclusions&gt;</code> element to control
          transitive dependencies.</p>

          <li>data - (optional) for arbitrary data</li>

                                    <p>Addon projects have multiple binary build artifacts:
      <ul>
        <li>binary assembly for the individual addon</li>
        <li>binary assembly for aggregate of all the addons</li>
        <li>PEAR packaging</li>

                                                <p>Since these have many common parts, we use the maven lifecycle to order building of shared
    common things ahead of their use:
    <ul>
      <li>package phase: build JARs, docbooks, etc.</li>
      <li>pre-integration-test phase: this is the first phase after <code>package</code>, and is 
      used to copy the Jar and docbook processing results to a common directory structure (base-bin).</li>
      <li>integration-test phase: this is the 2nd phas after <code>package</code>, and is
      used to copy the common things from base-bin to places for building the PEAR and OSGi artifacts.
      It is also used for running the packaging steps sequentially, after the copy, for the PEAR, OSGi,
      and single project assemblies.</li>
      <li>post-integration-test phase: this is used to mark the generated PEAR file for "attachment"
      using the maven-build-helper, so it gets deployed to the maven repositories.</li>
    </ul>
