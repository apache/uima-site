things and arranges POMs in a parent-child hierarchy, by having the child 
identify the parent POM.

    <li>
      The other kind is aggregation - POMs which specify sub-modules
for purposes of building multi-module things, and releasing them all at once.
    </li>
  </ol>  
  For clarity,
we mostly keep these two uses in separate POMs:  parent POMs do not do aggregation, 
and aggregation POMs do not do common factoring.</p>

  needed for building, but which are not part of normal uima release distributions.
  Aggregation POMs are kept within the SCM parent directory containing those modules being aggregated,
  in a "flat hierarchy" structure.</p>

                                    <p>When writing a new POM, it is best to start with an existing POM for a similar
    kind of project, and derive the new POM from that.  Some points:
    <ul>
      <li><p>POMs contain a <code>&lt;url&gt;</code> element, which is supposed to 
        point to the UIMA website page for this artifact (or the main UIMA page).  
        If a POM doesn't have this element, it will inherit one from its parent
        but Maven will assume (usually incorrectly in our case) 
        that the url is the parent url value followed by "/" and
        this POMs artifactId.</p>
        
        <p>So, If this does not correspond to how the website is set up,
        please specify the url that is correct for the new project.</p>
      </li>
      <li>The SCM connection is needed for releasing - and needs to be accurate for this
        component.  The same defaulting is applied as above, which is incorrect for our
        flat layout, so each POM needs to have an explicit SCM element.</li>
      <li>The POM's "version" is stated literally, not via a "property", etc.  
        Maven 3 
        will complain if you use properties here, and the release mechanism for maven
        manipulates these values (removing SNAPSHOT, incrementing things, etc.)</li>
      <li>The POM's groupId is omitted if it's the same as the parent pom's

    See the <a href="dev-docbook.html">how to use docbook</a> page for information
    about how to write Docbook style documentation, and how it is processed during building.</p>

    For large generated documents, 
    we have the option to generate them from sources in svn,

    The UIMA Project, in addition to the main frameworks (the UIMA SDK and the UIMA-AS addon), 
    has Annotators and other components and tools 
    (such as the SimpleServer) that it releases.  These in the past have been released as a big
    assembly we called the Sandbox, but now are are being supported as individual items.
  </p>
                                                <p>
    Two kinds of packaging for these are available, chosen by specifying one of the following parent-poms:
    <ul><li>parent-pom-annotator - this packages things as a PEAR</li>
      <li>parent-pom-single-project - this packages things as a tar / zip file having a lib/ directory
        with the generated Jar and dependencies (see below).</li></ul>
  </p>
                                                <p>
    The individual Annotators are mostly packaged as 
    <a href="http://uima.apache.org/downloads/releaseDocs/2.3.0-incubating/docs/html/references/references.html#ugr.ref.pear">
      PEAR</a> files, which are the UIMA standard for annotator component packaging and distribution.
    The Pear is generated using the PearPackagingMavenPlugin, which generates automatically a
    conventional Pear Installation Descriptor, from the information in the project.    
    The PEAR artifact is generated in addition to Jar of the code, and includes
    other items such as the generated documentation, data, and a lib/ directory with other Jars
    needed for the PEAR to operate.  This PEAR is the packaged equivalent of a binary distribution
    artifact produced for the main framework, and comes with a license and notice that
    covers any included libraries.  Generated PEARs are included in the artifacts that are managed by
    Maven, and are available in the Maven repository system.
  </p>
                                                <p class="note">
    The PEAR internal folder "src" is not used by components here; the source is instead available 
    via the standard Maven source directory conventions.
  </p>
                                                <p>
    PEARs must have a "main" descriptor, which is the one normally used to configure and run 
    the annotator.  When using the parent-pom-annotator to indicate PEAR packaging, 
    you must include a property called <code>
    &lt;pearMainDescriptor&gt;</code> in the Annotator's POM, 
    whose value is the path from the project base directory
    identifying the main descriptor.  For example, if the folder "desc" was at the root of your project, the 
    value might be something like "desc/my-main-descriptor.xml".
  </p>
                                                <p>If an annotator isn't suitable for PEAR packaging, perhaps because it is inappropriate to have 
    one pre-done main descriptor, then the annotator can be packaged as a single-project, instead, by 
    making the POM's parent parent-pom-single-project.</p>
                                                <h2>Common conventions for structuring individually releaseable projects</h2>
                                                <p>Use these conventions to get your annotator properly packaged when you use the parent-pom-annotator or 
    the parent-pom-single-project as your parent pom:
    <ul>
      <li>Use &lt;package&gt;jar&lt;/package&gt; (which is the default, so it should be omitted), if there
        is a Jar that should be built (as is usually the case).  This will cause the main
       annotator Jar to be built, including any resources (plus the top-level desc folder, if it exists), 
       as normal.</li>
      <li>Create the required License, Notice, and optional Readme, and Release Notes files 
        in the project directory at the top level; these will be included in the
        PEAR or simple project binary assembly at the top level.  
        The License and Notice files should be for the entire project, including
        all third-party Jars etc. being distributed.
        <p style="margin-left: 2em">The generated Jar, which only has Apache-developed code, 
          will have the normal Apache License and Notice files.</p></li>
      <li>Dependencies: those marked with scope "compile" (the default) or "runtime"
        are copied to the PEAR or single-project's lib/ directory.  To keep a dependency needed for compiling
        from being included in the lib/, give it a scope of "provided".
        <p class="note">You may use the dependencies <code>&lt;exclusions&gt;</code> element to control
          transitive dependencies.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Using the following folders at the top level of your project (which 
        are the folders used in the "conventional" PEAR layout, 
        causes the contents of these folders to be added to the corresponding files in the PEAR or binary zip/tar:
        <ul>
          <li>desc - for descriptiors, including the main descriptor</li>
          <li>bin - (optional) for extra executables</li>
          <li>lib - (optional) for libraries (not being included via the Maven dependencies mechanism)</li>
          <li>doc - (optional) not normally used, but can have additional user-ready documentation</li>
          <li>data - (optional) for arbitrary data</li>
          <li>resources - (optional) not normally used, but can have additional data which should be on the classpath</li>
          <li>conf - (optional) for extra configuration files</li>
          <li>src - not-used - Maven conventions for src directories are used instead</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>The following Maven conventional information will be added in the generated PEAR:
        <ul>
          <li>lib - dependencies with scope "compile" or "runtime" are resolved from maven repositories and added to the lib/</li>
          <li>doc - docbook sources under src/docbook are processed and the html and pdf forms are added</li>
          <li>Maven resources - (not the top level resources directory described above) 
            are by convention included in the Jar, and are not included in this folder</li>
