      <p>This document defines the guidelines of the Apache UIMA&#0153; Project. It includes
        definitions of the various categories of membership, who is able to vote, how

        making changes to the codebase of the Project.</p>
      
      <p>This project's purpose is to develop Apache-licensed implementations of the UIMA
      standard being developed by the UIMA Technical Committee at 
      <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=uima">
        https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=uima
      </a>.  As such, we will not incorporate changes into the project which are not compliant with 
      the standard, and will evolve implementations here to be compliant with the evolving changes
      in the standard.</p>
