<section name="Building UIMA from sources">

<p>
  We use <a class="external" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" 
    href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>, release 3.0 or later, for building.
  
  Most of us use <a class="external" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"
    href="">Eclipse</a> as the IDE for working with Java.  Maven has a plugin for Eclipse,
  <a class="external" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"
    href="http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/">m2eclipse</a>, that is useful in working with Maven from
    within Eclipse.
</p>

<subsection name="Building one project - using the command line">
  <ol>
    <li><p>
      Check out one project from SVN: for example, (Windows)<br/>
        <code>  svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/uima/uimaj/trunk/uimaj-core c:/myWorkingDir/uimaj-core</code></p>
      <p>If you have <a class="external" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" 
    href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">tortoiseSVN</a> windows shell extensions installed, 
    you can use the <code>repo-browser</code> right-click menu option to do this.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
      <code>cd to that directory</code> where you checked out the project.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>mvn install</code></p>
      <p>This will build that one project and install it to your local Maven repository.</p>
    </li>  
  </ol>
</subsection>  

<subsection name="Building all the projects for a major component - using command line">
  <p>For convenience, the build, uimaj, uima-as, and add-ons major components define "aggregate"
    projects which use Maven's &lt;modules> element to specify groups of individual projects
    that can be then built in one operation.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>
      Check out a set of projects from SVN: for example, (Windows):<br/>
      <code>  svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/uima/uimaj/trunk c:/myWorkingDir/uimaj</code>, or <br/>
      <code>  svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/uima/build/trunk c:/myWorkingDir/build</code>, or <br/>
      <code>  svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/uima/uima-as/trunk c:/myWorkingDir/uima-as</code>, etc.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
      <code>cd to that directory</code> where you checked out the projects
      </p>
    </li><li><p>
      <code>cd to the aggregate</code>, e.g., aggregate-uimaj or aggregate-build, or aggregate-uima-as, etc.
      </p>
    </li><li><p>
      <code>mvn install</code></p>
      <p>This will build that all the projects in that aggregate and install them to your local Maven repository.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</subsection>  

<subsection name="Building using Eclipse, with the m2eclipse plugin">
  <ol>
    <li>Checkout one or many projects, as above, into some location.  Then use 
      Eclipse menu: File &#x02192; import &#x02192; Maven &#x02192; Existing Maven projects
      to import those projects into the Eclipse workspace and set them up for
      Maven building.</li>
    <li>To run maven commands on a project, select the project, right click, and pick <code>Run as</code>
      and then select mvn install (or other choice as you wish).</li>
  </ol>
