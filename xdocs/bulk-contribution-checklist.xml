        The Apache Software Foundation
           Apache UIMA Project
        Bulk Contribution Checklist
               v1.0  20070111

The Apache UIMA project is dedicated to producing a codebase that 
has clear IP pedigree and protects the IP rights of others.  As part 
of this effort, we ask the following questions of all contributions
of software that has been created outside of the project.  Our goal is
to provide clear and consistent oversight of the project codebase, as 
well as encourage our contributors to carefully examine their 
contributions before bringing to the project.

Please Note : This document and your answers are considered public
information, and shall be part of the Apache UIMA project public 
records.

   are you an Authorized Committer on the Apache UIMA project?

  [ ] Yes
  [ ] No

  If "yes", you're done with Part III, skip to Part IV
  If "no" please continue with the rest of Part III

b) Have you verified the development history of the code to
   identify ALL of the authors?

   Please list the other authors:


c) Do you have a written agreement with all of the authors that
   either gives you ownership of the material or otherwise provides
   you sufficient rights to submit this material to the project
   on their behalf.

   Please provide the details of this agreement:


d) Are all of the authors Authorized Apache UIMA Committers for the part of
   the contribution written/created by each author?

  [ ] Yes ? if "yes", you're done with Part III, skip to Part IV.
  [ ] No ? if "no", please continue with the rest of part III


  <!--
e) Was the code written prior to May 2005 (when the Harmony Project
   was initiated)?

  [ ] Yes
  [ ] No

  (i)  If No, you must provide Authorized Contributor Questionnaires  
       for the authors of the code created after May 2005 such that 
       those authors  are classified as Authorized Contributors for 
       the portions of the contribution  written by them
       after May 2005.

    -->
e) Did any of the authors of the code have access to third  
   party implementations of similar technology while developing the  
   contribution?

  [ ] Yes
  [ ] No

  If "yes", please give details below :


f) Was the code developed in accordance with a  development  
   process which was designed to prevent unauthorized inclusion 
   of third party  intellectual property rights into the code?  
   (e.g., does the process require that developers not have 
   concurrent access to third party implementations of similar 
   technology during development?)

  [ ] Yes
  [ ] No

  If "no", the code isn't eligible for the Apache UIMA Project.

  If "yes", please provide short description of the process,  
  focusing on protections related to third party intellectual 
  property :
  
  
  

Note : The Apache UIMA project generally performs additional 
scans of it's codebase, including bulk contributions, to help 
confirm code pedigree.  Prior to submitting any contribution,
we strongly encourage you to verify that the contribution is
acceptable.  Please see
