      <subsection name="How to do a board report">
        <p>Board reports are kept in the website project, under docs/board-reports.
           The naming convention is the year-month.txt, e.g. 2019-05.txt.</p>
        <p>A service is available that collects various statistics that can be included in the report:
           <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reporter.apache.org">reporter.apache.org.</a>
           This service is offered by the ComDev PMC, source at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" 
             href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/comdev/reporter.apache.org">svn.apache.org/repos/asf/comdev/reporter.apache.org.</a>
           dev@community.apache.org is the place to engage and send patches for this tool.</p>          
        <p>Requirements for the contents of a board report are documented here - 
           <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/board/reporting">https://www.apache.org/foundation/board/reporting</a>.</p>
        <p>The board members want the reports to reflect the health of the community; so the report should be written
           by a person, not by the reporting tool, in order to have the best insight into the health of our community.</p>
