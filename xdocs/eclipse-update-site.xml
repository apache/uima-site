<section name="UIMA's Eclipse Update Site">

<p>
The Apache UIMA&#0153; project maintains an Eclipse update site as part 
of its prebuilt artifacts.  The information on this page is mainly for
developers, and documents how this update site is managed.
</p>

<p>
Over time, the update site ends up containing various Eclipse features
and their plugins, at different "versions".  It uses the (evolving) Eclipse standard
mechanisms to install whatever version a user might require.
</p>

<p>
Because of this, the update site itself keeps "older" versions.  Every
time a new release is made which includes one or more new versions of some
Eclipse features/plugins, these artifacts are built and <em>added</em> to 
the set of existing (and perhaps, older versions of) feature and plugins.
</p>

<subsection name="Early Optimizations">
<p>
The first UIMA Eclipse update sites were optimized by the then-current
approach to optimization.  This included 2 special things:
<ul>
<li>"super-duper" packing of the jar files using some new compression 
utilities that came with Java 5.</li>
<li>A separate copy of all the metadata needed for initial processing
by the Eclipse update mechanism - put into a compressed "digest.zip".</li>
<p>
See <a target="_blank"
href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Update_Site_Optimization">http://wiki.eclipse.org/Update_Site_Optimization</a>,
which describes the design goals for this.</p>
<p class="note">But note that the information on this page is now out of date, and has been
superseded by a second version of update site packaging.  In fact, the 
previously available headless Eclipse application, <em>org.eclipse.update.core.siteOptimizer</em>, is no
longer part of Eclipse releases.
</p>
</ul>
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="P2">
<p>
At some point in the evolution of the Eclipse update site mechanisms,  
the "P2" approach for Eclipse update sites became supported.
It has some changes (among others):
</p>
<ul>
<li>It adds to the normal metadata about components, the detailed
version and dependency information contained in the manifest of the
OSGi component JARs.  This is a finer-grained versioning system in which
version information is associated with Java Packages, in contrast
to the entire contents of a Jar being the entity which is versioned.
<p>Some tooling, such as <a target="_blank"
href="http://eclipse.org/tycho/">http://eclipse.org/tycho/Tycho</a>, 
need this finer-grained information
to resolve dependencies.</p></li>
<li>
It continues the previous approach of putting a copy of the metadata
in a separately downloaded file (formerly, the digest.zip).  In P2 
this is now in 2 files: content.xml
and artifacts.xml. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some of the UIMA plugin projects need to have the "high-fidelity" resolution of software
dependencies that comes with the P2 repositories.
</p>

<p>
As of January 2013, we are converting to the P2 style of update sites, and
will not build the update site for pre-P2 style because P2 support has been
in Eclipse for several years (since mid 2008).  
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Layout and Versioning">
<p>
Since the Eclipse update site is something that is added to whenever 
particular components are released, the maven projects used to support it
are in a shared location, under the SVN folder for our build tooling:
<a target="_blank"
  href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/uima/build/trunk/eclipse-packagings">
  http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/uima/build/trunk/eclipse-packagings</a>.
</p>
<p>This is a change from our previous organization, which placed the 
update-site project in the uimaj part of our repository (which holds the 
source code for the Java SDK of the base UIMA).</p>

<p>Feature plugin projects are associated with particular parts of
the UIMA project (such as the textmarker, or Java Base SDK, etc.),
and reside within those major components.</p>

<p>
Because the Update Site is a mere repackaging of released artifacts, it
is treated more like our website, in the sense that changes here are not
versioned.  However, because the update site contains downloadable
signed artifacts, they are not hosted on our website, but rather on the
official Apache distribution mirror system.  The meta information in the
update site includes references to the Apache mirror system, so 
the Eclipse install mechanism can use the mirrors.
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Composite Update Sites">
<p>
Update sites can be composite.  A composite update site
merely includes pointers to other update sites.  The installation
procedure combines all of the composite update sites mentioned
in the top level composite description into one, for purposes
of displaying and working with it.  We use the composite mechanism
to make maintenance of independently developed features more isolated;
when a new version of a sub-site is developed, updates are 
localized to just that sub-site.
</p>

<p>Our subsites are named subfolders of the main update site 
(.../dist/uima/eclipse-update-site).</p>

<p>
We currently have sub-sites for
<ul>
<li>uimaj - base Java UIMA SDK tools and runtime
</li>
<li>uima-as - addons for the base tooling to add the deployment descriptor editor, and uima-as runtime</li>
<li>TextEditor (coming soon)</li>
</ul>
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="How to Change the Update Site">
<p>To do any work on the Eclipse update sites, you must have
maven property variables set to identify an accessible Eclipse
installation so the Eclipse packaging tooling and Ant support
can be located.  These are typically put into your .m2 setttings.xml
file like this:</p>
<pre>
&lt;uima-maven-build-eclipse-home>C:/x/y/z/eclipse&lt;/uima-maven-build-eclipse-home>
&lt;eclipse-equinox-launcher>
  ${uima-maven-build-eclipse-home}/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.1.1.R36x_v20101122_1400.jar
&lt;/eclipse-equinox-launcher>
</pre>
<p>We use the Composite pattern for our update site, to allow a
cleaner separation of independent sets of Features, for maintenance
ease.  The first decision when doing an update is to decide if 
you need to add a new sub-update-site to the set managed by the
Composite collection.  If so, update the script part inside the
POM (follow the commented instructions) to add the sub-site.</p>

<p>
To update a sub-site, go to that subsite's project for its update-site.
For example, for uimaj, this is the project uimaj-eclipse-update-site.
In that project, run the Eclipse category editor to update the categories
(if necessary).
</p>

<p>
Each update site "build" will use the pom to pull into a prototype
update site in its /target directory the complete set of features and plugins.
It does this using information specified in the POM, as dependencies.
It does this for all versions of the features and plugins.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, you must edit this POM if you are specifying new versions
of any of the features and plugins, and add those dependencies to the 
list inside of the build step that copies the plugin and feature 
dependencies.
</p>

<p>
Running <code>mvn package</code> on the update site pom will produce a 
P2 update site in /target/eclipse-update-site.  When releasing, the
contents of this directory needs to be copied into the appropriately
named subfolder for this sub-site in the release spot for UIMA
distribution.
