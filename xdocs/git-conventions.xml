    <title>GIT Conventions for UIMA projects</title>

    <section name="Git Conventions">
    
    <p>This describes various conventions and the reasons behind them, concerning use of GIT.</p>
    
    <h3>Branch naming</h3>
    
    <h4>master</h4>
    
      <p>This is the main branch where things are merged into, and from time to time, releases are made from.</p>
      <p>Some project may have multiple branches.  These typically reflect on-going versions being developed together.</p>
    
    <h4>branches for working</h4>
      <p>Work is done in a branch.  This because the master(s) are protected, which means they cannot be "pushed" to, 
        but rather, a change must be pulled from a branch via a pull request.</p>
        
      <p>Branches for working are typically named using the Jira issue (if there is one) associated with the work, 
        followed by a very-short-description - enough to remind you what that jira number is about.
        In addition, the name can be prefixed with the kind of work it is, e.g. 
        <code>feature/</code> or <code>bugfix</code> or <code>refactor</code>.
        This can be useful in enabling you to more rapidly locate the right branch.</p>
          
      <p>After merging into master, the branch is typically deleted.</p>   
      
    <h3>Commit messages</h3>
    
    <p>Example: <code>[UIMA-1234] Add missing foo to bar</code></p>
    
    <p>Git has a two-section commit message.  The first line should be a one-line id and summary.  
       Following that is an optional section of multiple lines that are details about the commit.</p>
       
    <p>The first line should start with the jira issue number including UIMA- prefix.  Automatic scanners
       use this to connect this to the Jira issue.  You may put multiple issues if applicable.  The issues may
       be written with surrounding square brackets, e.g. <code>[UIMA-1234]</code>.</p>  
    <p>Following that should be short title of the issue, since looking back at it a reader probably won't remember
       what the issue was all about.  Following that can be a summary of what this particular commit does.</p>
          
    <h4>Git merge styles</h4>
      <p>Different projects may use different merge styles.</p>   
      <p>See these links for references to common work patterns.  TBD</p>
