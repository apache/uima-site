			name="IKS Semantic Search - Fact and Fiction Workshop in Rome/Italy">

			<p>
				IKS European project [
				<a href="#1">1</a>
				] had its second IKS Workshop. They have
				been
				meeting in
				Rome on
				November 12th and 13th, 2009. The purpose for
				this
				workshop
				was to
				define "semantic search", and to get a handle on
				what
				people want from
				it.
			</p>

			<p>
				During the IKS workshop there has been a speech/demo about UIMA and
				Semantic Search.
				<br />
				We got good feedback about UIMA in general from the
				people at the
				workshop; Bertrand Delacretaz, who is part of IKS as
				Day Software
				employee and also member of ASF, had a good feeling
				about UIMA for
				semantic search to include inside IKS stack [
				<a href="#2">2</a>
				].
				<br />
				Moreover the Nuxeo open source ECM [
				<a href="#3">3</a>
				]
				is developing its semantic search module
				on the top of UIMA (see
				Oliver Grisel's wrap up on their website [
				<a href="#4">4</a>
				]).
				<br />
				Slides
				about the UIMA and Semantic Search talk are available at [
				<a href="#5">5</a>
				].
				<br />
				Demos were
				about a real estate market analysis tool which
				uses
				UIMA
				for
				metadata extraction and a sample of integration
				between UIMA and
				AlchemyAPI.
				<br />
				See some photos here [
				<a href="#6">6</a>
				] and the complete list of talks here
