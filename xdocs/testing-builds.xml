<section name="Setup for testing - adding the Staging repository">  
  <p>
    Prepare for testing by going to 
    <a href="building-uima.html">building-uima</a>
    and doing the one-time setup, if you haven't done this already.  This includes installing Maven 3.
  </p><p>
    In addition, do the following one-time setup for accessing the staging-repository:
    <ol>
        <li>Set up your maven "settings.xml" file (located in the directory containing your local repository;
    in windows, this is c:Documents and Settings\&lt;your-userid>\.m2\settings.xml. The idea is to add 
    a repository spec called "staged-release" that points to the staging repository of interest (this 
    may change from release to release - the right url will be provided in the test vote email). 
    Here's a sample settings file, with just this profile element in it:
<pre>
&lt;settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
                      http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">

  &lt;profiles>
    &lt;profile>
      &lt;id>staged-release&lt;/id>
      &lt;repositories>
        &lt;repository>
          &lt;id>staged-release&lt;/id>
          &lt;url>https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapacheuima-042/&lt;/url>
        &lt;/repository>
      &lt;/repositories>
    &lt;/profile>
  &lt;/profiles>

&lt;/settings>
</pre>   
  </li>
    </ol>
