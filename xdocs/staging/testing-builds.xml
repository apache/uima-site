<section name="Setup (one time) for building">
<ol>
  <li>Set up Eclipse (optional):
    <ol><li>add m2Eclipse and the patch (see svn.html) and subversion</li></ol>
  </li>
  <li>Set up your maven "settings.xml" file (located in the directory containing your local repository;
    in windows, this is in c:Documents and Settings\<your-userid>\.m2</your-userid>. Here's a sample:
<pre>
&lt;settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
                      http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">

  &lt;profiles>
    &lt;profile>
      &lt;id>staged-release&lt;/id>
      &lt;repositories>
        &lt;repository>
          &lt;id>staged-release&lt;/id>
          &lt;url>https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapacheuima-042/&lt;/url>
        &lt;/repository>
      &lt;/repositories>
    &lt;/profile>
  &lt;/profiles>

&lt;/settings>
</pre>   
  </li>
  
  <li>Fix the docbkx code: There's a one line fix needed, which hasn't been released (see 
    <a class="external" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"
      href="http://code.google.com/p/docbkx-tools/issues/detail?id=52">http://code.google.com/p/docbkx-tools/issues/detail?id=52</a>.
    <p>To fix, do the following:
      <ol><li>use m2Eclipse to checkout 
        http://docbkx-tools.googlecode.com/svn/tags/docbkx-2.0.10/docbkx-maven-base project</li>
        <li>Edit line 472, where it says ...getResources("/catalog.xml") and remove the / in front of "catalog.xml".</li>
        <li>do a "mvn install" to your local repo.</li>
      </ol>
        
      </p>  
    </li>
</ol>  
</section>

<section name="Testing the parent-pom-top build">

<ol>
  <li>Check out the build directory:
    <pre>svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/uima/build/trunk some-checkout-local-dir</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Checkout something to build (to verify that the parent-pom-top works:
    <pre>svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/uima/uimaj/trunk  some-checkout-local-dir</pre>
  </li>
  
  <li>If you want, using m2Eclipse, import existing projects as maven projects, and select the build
    directories, and import the build projects.  Repeat for the uimaj projects.</li>
  <li>Using your favorite find/replace tools, find all instances of where the parent-pom-top is used
    which specifies a version of 1-SNAPSHOT, and change those to just 1 (that's what is being tested).
  </li>
  
  <li>Build the build tooling:
    <pre>
  cd to the build checkout dir / parent-poms
  mvn -Pstaged-release install
  
  cd to uimaj checkout dir / aggregate-uimaj
  mvn -Pstaged-release install 
</pre></li>  
</ol>

<p>If no errors, then conclude that the parent-pom-top is "good" and vote +1 :-) .</p>

<p class="note">Afterwards, go to your local repo and remove the org/apache/uima/parent-pom-top/1 directory,
  to prevent it from accidentally being used, until it passes official release.</p>
