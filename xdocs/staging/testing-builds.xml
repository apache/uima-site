<section name="Setup (one time) for building">
<ol>
  <li>Do the normal <a href="one-time-setup.html">one-time-setup</a> if you haven't already done this.</li>
  <li>Set up your maven "settings.xml" file (located in the directory containing your local repository;
    in windows, this is in c:Documents and Settings\<your-userid>\.m2</your-userid>. Here's a sample:
<pre>
&lt;settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
                      http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">

  &lt;profiles>
    &lt;profile>
      &lt;id>staged-release&lt;/id>
      &lt;repositories>
        &lt;repository>
          &lt;id>staged-release&lt;/id>
          &lt;url>https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapacheuima-042/&lt;/url>
        &lt;/repository>
      &lt;/repositories>
    &lt;/profile>
  &lt;/profiles>

&lt;/settings>
</pre>

    <p class="note">
      <b>Note:</b> The url element above is just a sample; each release will have its own unique staging repository name.

<section name="Testing the parent-pom-top build">

<ol>
  <li>Check out the build directory:
    <pre>svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/uima/build/trunk some-checkout-local-dir</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Checkout something to build (to verify that the parent-pom-top works:
    <pre>svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/uima/uimaj/trunk  some-checkout-local-dir</pre>
  </li>
  
  <li>If you want, using m2Eclipse, import existing projects as maven projects, and select the build
    directories, and import the build projects.  Repeat for the uimaj projects.</li>
  <li>Using your favorite find/replace tools, find all instances of where the parent-pom-top is used
    which specifies a version of 1-SNAPSHOT, and change those to just 1 (that's what is being tested).
  </li>
  
  <li>Build the build tooling:
    <pre>
  cd to the build checkout dir / parent-poms
  mvn -Pstaged-release install
  
  cd to uimaj checkout dir / aggregate-uimaj
  mvn -Pstaged-release install 
</pre></li>  
</ol>

<p class="note">Afterwards, go to your local repo and remove the org/apache/uima/parent-pom-top/1 directory,
  to prevent it from accidentally being used, until it passes official release, unless this component
  is needed (depended upon) by further artifacts in the group being released.
