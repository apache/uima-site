<section name="What's New: Apache UIMA SDK Version 3">

  <p>Here you will find samples of new features available in 
     UIMA version 3, often preceeded by a sample of how something
     similar was done in version 2, for comparison.</p>
  
  <p>UIMA Version 3 is designed to run existing UIMA Pipelines, 
     requiring only one kind of change if your pipeline made use of
     non-built-in JCas classes.
  </p>
  
  <p>These JCas classes must be regenerated (if you're using the
    Maven JCasGen plugin as part of your project's build, this will happen
    automatically), or migrated.  The 
    <a href="/d/uimaj-v3-current/version_3_users_guide.html">
      UIMA Version 3 user's guide</a> describes the migration process
      and tooling that is available that automates this process.
