      <title>Description</title>
      <p>Distributed UIMA Cluster Computing (DUCC) is a cluster management system providing tooling, management, and
scheduling facilities to automate the scale-out of applications using the UIMA framework.</p>
      <p>Core UIMA provides a generalized framework for applications that process unstructured
information such as human language, but does not provide a scale-out mechanism.  UIMA-AS
provides a scale-out mechanism to distribute UIMA pipelines over a cluster of computing
resources, but does not provide job or cluster management of the resources.  DUCC completes the
set by providing job support, cluster management, and life-cycle automation for the scale-out of UIMA
applications, using UIMA-AS, on large computing clusters</p>
<p>The contribution includes components that use Apache ActiveMQ and Apache Camel as a messaging
infrastructure. It also includes Jetty to display DUCC's cluster information in web browsers, as well as enabling
cluster control.</p>
      <p>
The contributed code is in the "sandbox" area of the UIMA SVN: 
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/uima/sandbox/uima-ducc/ , where it is being cleaned up and otherwise worked on. 
The original donation is in a zip file attached to a JIRA issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-2491.
      </p>
      <p>
The donation codebase is a set of new modules and documentation and does not contain patches for other components.
