      <title>Description</title>
  <p>Apache UIMA TextMarker is a rule-based script language supported by Eclipse-based
tooling. The language is designed to enable rapid development of text processing applications
within UIMA. A special focus lies on the intuitive and flexible domain specific language for
defining patterns of annotations. The Eclipse-based tooling for TextMarker, called the TextMarker
Workbench, was created to support the user and to facilitate every step when writing TextMarker
rules. Both the TextMarker rule language and the TextMarker Workbench integrate smoothly with
Apache UIMA.

  <p>
      TextMarker is contributed as zip-file with multiple java projects and a zip file with wiki content.
