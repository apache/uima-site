      <p>AlchemyAPI Annotator is a set of analysis engines wrapping
        AlchemyAPI online services (see <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com">here</a>)
        for extracting entities, keywords,
        language, microformats and other
        from either text or URLs.</p>
      <p>
        The contributed code is in the "sandbox" area of the UIMA SVN:
        <a
          href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/uima/sandbox/trunk/AlchemyAPIAnnotator/">
          http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/uima/sandbox/trunk/AlchemyAPIAnnotator/
        </a>
        . The original donation is in a zip file attached to a JIRA
        issue:
        <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-1733">
          http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-1733
        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        The donation codebase is a set of new modules and documentation
        and does
        not contain patches for other components.
