       <p>(Note: the original name of the donation was UIMA-EE; this name was 
           changed while in the incubator to UIMA-AS)</p>
       <p>
        The contribution is a set of components that extend the Apache 
         UIMA framework to support fine-grained "scale-out" to multiple independent 
         processes (potentially running in a LAN/WAN), using techniques that make use of
         JMS (Java Messaging Service) standards.  It includes components
         that use Apache ActiveMQ as the messaging infrastructure.  Also
         included are Eclipse plugin components for editing a new XML 
         descriptor, used to describe the deployment of a UIMA service
         using this new kind of scale-out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The contributed code is in the "sandbox" area of the UIMA SVN:
        <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/incubator/uima/sandbox/trunk/uima-as/">
          http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/incubator/uima/sandbox/trunk/uima-as/
        </a>, where it is being cleaned up and otherwise worked on.  The 
        original donation is in a zip file attached to a JIRA issue:
        <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-689">
          http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-689
        </a>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The donation codebase is a set of new modules and documentation and does 
        not contain patches for other components.
