      <title>Description</title>
      <p>ConceptMapper is a powerful, highly configurable dictionary UIMA-based annotator. 
        Numerous parameters can be used to specify various aspects of the lookup algorithm, 
        input processing and output options. The dictionary structure is flexible, allowing 
        any number synonyms to be associated with an entry, and any number of attributes to 
        be associated with entries or synonyms. 
        Additionally, ConceptMapper can be used with any tokenizer, enabling tokenization 
        of the dictionary identically with the input text.</p>
            <p>
        The contributed code is in the "sandbox" area of the UIMA SVN:
        <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/incubator/uima/sandbox/trunk/ConceptMapper/">
          http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/incubator/uima/sandbox/trunk/ConceptMapper/
        </a>.  The original donation is in a zip file attached to a JIRA issue:
        <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-1033">
          http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-1033
        </a>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The donation codebase is a set of new modules and documentation and does 
        not contain patches for other components.
