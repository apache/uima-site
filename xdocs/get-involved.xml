<section name="How do I contribute, give feedback, fix bugs and so on?">

<p>
The Apache UIMA&#0153; project is actively seeking new contributors to work on all
  aspects of the project.  We need and appreciate all contributions,
including documentation help, source code development and feedback. 
  </p>
  
  <p>A typical path to contributing might start with joining the 
    <a href="mail-lists.html">UIMA mailing lists</a>
    where discussions are occuring among the users and developers, and getting a 
    <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/UIMA">JIRA</a>
    id and posting feature improvements, bug reports, etc. to the change tracking 
    system we're using.
    </p>
    <p>Anyone is invited to contribute to the project; for contributions
    beyond simple typo fixes or short patches, we request you fill out, sign, and send in
    Apache's Individual Contributer License Agreement
    <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas">(ICLA)</a> - and if appropriate, the 
    matching Corporate Contributor License Agreement 
    <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas">(CCLA)</a>.  Then you can post larger
    patches to Jira issues you raise.

    </p>
    
    <p>Contributors who develop a history of successful participation over time are invited
      to join the project as a <b>committer</b>, which means they will have direct write-access
      to the SVN repositories for the project.
    </p>

<section name="How do I become a contributor or a committer?">
<p>Everyone can contribute to UIMA as a contributor;  contributors who
  build up a history of successful contributions over time are invited to 
  become committers.  The difference is that committers have direct write
  access to the project SVN repositories, while contributors post their 
  contributions to Jira issues where they're first reviewed, and then committed
  by a committer to the project's SVN repository.
  See <a href="https://www.apache.org/dev/contributors.html">https://www.apache.org/dev/contributors.html</a>
  for a good overview of working as a contributor.
  </p>
  
  <p>We ask contributors of significant amounts of code to fill out and
    send into Apache, an 
    <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas">Individual 
    Contributors License Agreement (ICLA)</a>
    (and perhaps also a 
    <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas">Corporate 
    Contributors License Agreement (CCLA)</a>). 
    </p>
  
  <p>
  If you're interested in committing to the project, you need to establish
  a history over time of successful contributions to the project.  After that,
  you can be invited to become a committer; see
    <a href="roles.html">this page</a> for more details on this process.
  </p>
<ul>
<li><p> You'll need to fill out some legal paperwork and go through 
a process to get an apache committer account: See 
<a  class="external" rel="nofollow noopener" 
href="https://apache.org/dev/new-committers-guide.html">
New Committers Guide</a>, 
<a  class="external" rel="nofollow noopener" 
href="https://apache.org/dev/contributors.html"> Contributors</a>, and 
<a  class="external" rel="nofollow noopener" 
href="https://apache.org/dev/committers.html"> Committers</a> 
for more details. </p>

</li>
<li><p> After you've received an email from 
<a  href="mailto:root@apache.org">root@apache.org</a> 
with your committer account information, change your initial password: 
Login by 'ssh -l &lt;username&gt; people.apache.org'; 
run 'passwd'; 
run 'svnpasswd'.  See 
<a  class="external" rel="nofollow noopener" 
href="https://apache.org/dev/version-control.html">Committer Subversion Access
</a>. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Check out the UIMA sources and test your svn account: 
<a  href="https://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/uima">
SubversionRepository</a>. 
</p>

</li>
</ul>
  
  <p>All Contributors and Committers should</p>
