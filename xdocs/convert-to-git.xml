    <section name="Converting a project to GIT">
    
    <p>This describes the various steps needed in converting a project from SVN to GIT.</p>
    
    <h3>Setup Read-only mirror, if not already done</h3>
    
    <h3>File INFRA Jira ticket to convert read-only mirror to r/w</h3>
    
    <h3>File INFRA Jira tickets for additional setup or fixups</h3>
    
    <h4>Renaming Branches</h4>
    <p>In SVN, the main work goes into a spot under the name "trunk".  The convention in git is to name this
    the "master".</p>
    
    <p>GIT renaming cannot be done directly by users if the branch is "protected"; 
    you must instead request it be done via an INFRA issue.  This may take some time; see the kanban
    board on the INFRA jira to get a sense of how many other requests are in front of yours.</p>
    
    <blockquote>Therefore, it would be good to rename things yourself (e.g. in SVN).</blockquote>
    
    <h3>Add .gitignore and .gitattributes</h3>
	    <p>These files should be added to the top (outer-most) containing folder for the projects in your repo.
	       They will be default apply to all subfolders.  If you need to, you can override these settings in a subfolder.</p>
	       
	    <p>Copy these files from some already converted repo.</p>
	 
    <h3>Dealing with protected branches</h3>
    
    <p>The default, when converting a project from svn to git is to set "protection" for 
      the master branch and things called refs/heads/rel/ and refs/tags/rel/.  
    </p>
    <p>The protection is described here: 
       <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" 
          href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-protected-branches">
          https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-protected-branches</a>.</p>	 

    <p>Individual projects within UIMA may request additional branch protection settings be set, via
       INFRA Jira issues.</p>
