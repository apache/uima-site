				name="Does this project use a wiki?">
				<p>
					It does; see:
					<a href="http://cwiki.apache.org/UIMA/">
						UIMA wiki
					</a>
					. It will complement the work taking place on the
					mailing list and provide additional information on
					the project.

				name="Contributing a new file: what do I need to consider?">
				<p>
					Any new file should contain the
					<a
						href="http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html">
						Apache license header
					</a>
					. This is true of source code, but also XML files
					and many other source type files. License headers
					are not necessary for automatically generated files
					(such as javadoc) and binary files. Binary files may
					have licenses of their own, please be sure you know
					what you are doing when checking them in. When in
					doubt, please ask on uima-dev.
				</p>
				<p>
					For source code, please also follow the
					<a
						href="http://uima.apache.org/codeConventions.html">
						coding conventions
					</a>
					of the UIMA team.

			<subsection id="ugr.issues.cr_to_xml"
				name="Sun Java 1.4.2_12 doesn't serialize CR characters to XML">
				<p>
          (Note: Apache UIMA now requires Java 1.5 support - 
          so this issue is moot.)
					The XML serialization support in Sun Java 1.4.2_12
					doesn't serialize CR characters to XML. As a result,
					if the document text contains CR characters, XCAS or
					XMI serialization will cause them to be lost,
					resulting in incorrect annotation offsets. This is
					exposed in the DocumentAnalyzer, with the
					highlighting being incorrect if the input document
					contains CR characters.
				</p>
			</subsection>

			<subsection id="ugr.issues.jcasgen_java_1.4"
				name="JCasGen merge facility supports Java levels 1.4 or earlier">
				<p>
					JCasGen has a facility to merge in user (hand-coded)
					changes with the code generated by JCasGen. This
					merging supports Java 1.4 constructs only. JCasGen
					generates Java 1.4 code, so as long as any code you
					change here also onlu uses Java 1.4 constructs, the
					merge will work. If you use Java 5 or later specific
					syntax or constructs, the merge operation will
					likely fail to merge properly.
				</p>
			</subsection>

			<subsection id="ugr.issues.libgcj.4.1.2"
				name="Descriptor editor in Eclipse tooling does not work with libgcj 4.1.2">
				<p>
					The descriptor editor in the Eclipse tooling does
					not work with libgcj 4.1.2, and possibly other
					versions of libgcj. This is apparently due to a bug
					in the implementation of their XML library, which
					results in a class cast error. libgcj is used as the
					default JVM for Eclipse in Ubuntu (and other Linux
					distributions?). The workaround is to use a
					different JVM to start Eclipse.
