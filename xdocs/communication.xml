    The Project obtains its strength from the communication of its
    members. In order for members to easily communicate with each other,
    the Project has a variety of mailing lists. These lists, with the
    exception of the announcement lists, are not moderated and anybody
    is more than welcome to join them. However, you must be subscribed
    to post to a list.
   </p>

   <p>
    To reduce the bandwidth demands on everyone, mail should not contain
    attachments. It is recommended that you place interesting material
    either within the body of the message or provide a URL for
    retrieval. Patches are best done as attachments to a JIRA issue.
   </p>
