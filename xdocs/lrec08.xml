  There will be a <a href="http://watchtower.coling.uni-jena.de/~coling/uimaws_lrec2008/">workshop 
  dedicated to UIMA</a> at <a href="http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/">LREC 2008</a> 
  (the sixth international conference on Language Resources and Evaluation).  Please find the CFP below.

*********************************************************
                     CALL FOR PAPERS
Towards Enhanced Interoperability for Large HLT Systems:
                       UIMA for NLP
Full-day workshop held in conjunction with LREC 2008,
May 31, 2008, Marrakech, Morocco
Submission deadline: 29 February 2008
*********************************************************
The development and incremental modification of large and complex HLT
systems has long been an art rather than a workflow guided by software
engineering practices and principles. The interoperability of system
components was hard to achieve, exchange of different modules a 
pain-staking task due to the low level of abstraction of specifications 
which described interfaces to connect with each other, and data and 
control flow interdependencies between various modules.
UIMA, the Unstructured Information Management Architecture, is an
open-platform middleware structure for dealing with unstructured 
information (text, speech, audio, video data), originally launched by 
IBM. In the meantime, the Apache Software Foundation has established an 
incubator project for developing UIMA-based software 
(<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/uima/">http://incubator.apache.org/uima/</a>).  The Organization for the 
Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) has established 
a Technical Committee to standardize the UIMA specification. 
Accordingly, an increasing number of NLP research institutes as well as 
HLT companies all over the world are basing their system development 
efforts on UIMA specifications to adhere to emerging standards.
As far as NLP proper is concerned, Carnegie Mellon University's Language
Technology Institute is hosting an UIMA Component Repository web site
(<a href="http://uima.lti.cs.cmu.edu">http://uima.lti.cs.cmu.edu</a>), where developers can post information 
about their analytics components and anyone can find out more about free 
and commercially available UIMA-compliant analytics. Additionally, free 
analytic tools that can work with UIMA include those from the General 
Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE - <a href="http://gate.ac.uk/">http://gate.ac.uk/</a>) and 
OpenNLP (<a href="http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/">http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/</a>) communities, as well as Jena 
University&apos;s Language &amp; Information Engineering (JULIE) 
(<a href="http://www.julielab.de">http://www.julielab.de</a>) Lab. Commercial analytics are available from 
IBM, as well as from other software vendors such as Attensity, 
ClearForest, Temis and Nstein.
In this workshop we want to bring representatives from various NLP 
research sites together who have gained experience in working with UIMA
specifications in the framework of complex NLP systems. As there are 
already several large HLT systems that have been integrated with UIMA, 
we also encourage papers at the workshop which are in the form of case 
studies on those systems. We also aim at joining the results of their 
work to discuss and possibly elaborate on emerging UIMA standards for 
NLP systems.
===================
  Paper Submissions
===================
We seek high-quality papers which report on experience using UIMA for 
the design and implementation of complex NLP systems. However, papers 
reporting on experience using other middleware frameworks and software 
engineering practices in this context are also welcome. Both papers from 
academia as well as industry are solicited. The size of long paper 
should not exceed 8 pages, the size of short papers and demo 
descriptions should not exceed 4 pages (using the LREC formatting 
style). For details, please consult the submission section on the 
workshop website.
==================
  Important Dates

February 29, 2008 - Deadline for workshop papers
March 26, 2008 - Notification of acceptance
April 4, 2008 - Camera-ready papers due
