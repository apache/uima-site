        <p>Apache UIMA Ruta is a rule-based script language supported by
          Eclipse-based tooling. The language is designed to enable rapid
          development of text processing applications within UIMA. A special
          focus lies on the intuitive and flexible domain specific language for defining
          patterns of annotations. The Eclipse-based tooling,
          called the Apache UIMA Ruta Workbench, was created to support the
          user and to facilitate every step when writing rules. Both
          the rule language and the workbench integrate
          smoothly with Apache UIMA.

      <p>The UIMA core Java SDK adds some new capabilities and fixes some bugs.
      <ul>
          <li>External Override values are supported within UIMA Descriptor import statements
          and within the fileUrl value of fileResourceSpecifiers.</li>
          <li>External Overrides: support was added for searching the classpath and UIMA Datapath to find the
              external overrides.
              If a relative file name is specified but the file is not found, 
              the classpath and datapath will be searched.  
              This approach will be changed in the next release 
              to make a clearer distinction between file and classpath resources 
              in order to avoid the ambiguity of the current design; note   
              that this change will not be backwards-compatible.</li>

              for the built-in UIMA types FSArray, FSList,
              StringArray, and StringList now support the Iterable interface.</li>

        <p>Apache UIMA Ruta is a rule-based script language supported by
          Eclipse-based tooling. The language is designed to enable rapid
          development of text processing applications within UIMA. A special
          focus lies on the intuitive and flexible domain specific language for defining
          patterns of annotations. The Eclipse-based tooling,
          called the Apache UIMA Ruta Workbench, was created to support the
          user and to facilitate every step when writing rules. Both
          the rule language and the workbench integrate
          smoothly with Apache UIMA.

          This release requires an update of script projects and its descriptors in the UIMA Ruta Workbench. 
          There are several ways to achieve this. The recommended way is to right-click on the UIMA Ruta project and select "UIMA Ruta -> Convert to UIMA Ruta project", which will update all provided descriptors.
          Then, select the project and press "Project -> Clean..." in the menu, which will regenerate all descriptors of your scripts based on the new templates.
          Projects built with the UIMA Ruta Maven Plugin require no manual effort.

 <p>DUCC stands for Distributed UIMA Cluster Computing. DUCC is a cluster management system providing tooling,
management, and scheduling facilities to automate the scale-out of applications written to the UIMA framework.
Core UIMA provides a generalized framework for applications that process unstructured information such as human
language, but does not provide a scale-out mechanism. UIMA-AS provides a scale-out mechanism to distribute UIMA
pipelines over a cluster of computing resources, but does not provide job or cluster management of the resources.
DUCC defines a formal job model that closely maps to a standard UIMA pipeline. Around this job model DUCC
provides cluster management services to automate the scale-out of UIMA pipelines over computing clusters.

	      <p>This release is a bug fix release, plus one enhancement.  The version number incremented because

	      </p>
	      <p>An improvement was made to the performance of iterators over sorted indexes, such as the

	      many subtypes.</p>
	      
	      <p>Index usage by iterators in this situation is now monitored, and when it is determined 
	      that a particular index is no longer being updated and is experiencing poor performance due to merging of 
	      subindexes for the subtypes being iterated over, a one-time conversion of this index to a "flattened" version is done; 
	      the flattened form incurs the cost of merging subindexes once, and for subsequent uses, 
	      iteration overhead is reduced. Any update that affects this flattened index will cause it to be discarded 
        and not used for subsequent iterations.</p>
	      
	      <p>Performance improvement may be seen for use cases 
	      where one annotator creates and indexes instances of a type and its subtypes, and subsequent annotators 
	      read and perhaps update these, but don't add or remove entries of this type/subtypes from the index.

language, but does not provide a scale-out mechanism. UIMA-AS provides a scale-out mechanism to distribute UIMA
pipelines over a cluster of computing resources, but does not provide job or cluster management of the resources.
DUCC defines a formal job model that closely maps to a standard UIMA pipeline. Around this job model DUCC
provides cluster management services to automate the scale-out of UIMA pipelines over computing clusters.

        <p>Apache uimaFIT&#0153; is a library that 
          facilitates the building of Apache UIMA components, the programmatic use of Apache UIMA
          analysis pipelines, and their testing.

          uimaFIT employs Java annotations to integrate UIMA meta data directly into the source 
          code, allowing for less lines of code and better refactorability then traditional, XML 
          descriptor-based UIMA projects. It is capable of automatically detecting meta data,
          e.g. type system information, from the classpath. Convenience methods are provided for 
          constructing components, pipelines, and for accessing annotations.
          </p>
          
          <p>This is the first Apache release of the project previously known simply as "uimaFIT".</p>
          
          <p>The major changes in this release are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Migration to Apache Foundation as part of the Apache UIMA project.</li>
            <li>New Maven coordinates (groupId: org.apache.uima; artifactId: uimafit-core)</li>
            <li>New uimaFIT Maven plugin for automatically generating uimaFIT meta data in component
              classes and UIMA descriptors from uimaFIT-annotated component classes</li>
            <li>New module for backwards compatibility with uimaFIT 1.4.x-based components</li>
            <li>Consolidated documentation in HTML and PDF format</li>
            <li>Moved CPE support to separate dependency 
              (groupId: org.apache.uima; artifactId: uimafit-cpe)</li>
            <li>Improved component life-cycle handling</li>
            <li>New support for setting multi-valued parameters with simple single 
              values (no need to wrap them in a collection or array anymore)</li>
            <li>Improved support for external resources, including support for
              multi-valued external resources</li>  
          </ul>

		<p>Note on compatibility and migration: Apache uimaFIT 2.0.0 is not a drop-in replacement 
		  for uimaFIT 1.4.x, although, it was tried to keep the migration effort minimal. Please 
          refer to the <a href="d/uimafit-2.0.0/tools.uimafit.book.html#d5e617">

        <p>
          This release includes most of the projects in the Sandbox.  Those projects there
          that were ready to be released were moved to a new SVN top node in the 
          UIMA project, called "addons".  
        </p>
          
          <p>
          The addons package contains 2 new annotators: Solrcas (for storing CAS objects into an 
          Apache Solr instance), and AlchemyAPIAnnotator (wraps alchemyapi.com services).  
          </p>
          
          <p>Several fixes and improvements were made to other annotators.

        <p>
          At the ASF board meeting held on 17 March 2010, the Board unanimously approved the proposed resolution to 
          establish the Apache UIMA Project as a top level Apache project.  This signals the successful completion 
          of the incubation process and the beginning of the next phase of Apache UIMA existence.    
        </p>
        <p>
          Becoming a top level project entails setting up some new infrastructure, and moving things. 
          It will take some time to accomplish this move; in the meanwhile, we'll be keeping this website up to date.

      <subsection name='26 January 2010' date="26 January 2010" title="UIMA 2.3.0-incubating Released">
        <p>
          This release includes all 4 major components: 
          the UIMA Java SDK, UIMACPP, UIMA-AS (Asynchronous Scalout capability), 
          and a growing set of UIMA Addons.  It is backwards compatable with previous releases, except
          that Java 5 is now the minimum Java level required.</p>
          
          <p>
          The add-ons package contains many new components and annotators.  
          The UIMA-AS (Asynchronous Scaleout)
          framework is extensively enhanced with much more support for error/failure recovery, driven by feedback
          from actual use in several large scale deployments.  The base framework now supports Java 5 generics, and
          is enhanced to make it even more
          light-weight and efficient; for example, it now supports a new network serialization format  
          for communicating with remote
          annotators using a "delta-CAS" - limiting the response sent to just those items which have changed.
