    <subsection name="28 Sep 2016" date = "28 September 2016" title="Apache UIMA Ruta 2.5.0 released">
        <p>Apache UIMA Ruta is a rule-based script language supported by
          Eclipse-based tooling. The language is designed to enable rapid
          development of text processing applications within UIMA. A special
          focus lies on the intuitive and flexible domain specific language for defining
          patterns of annotations. The Eclipse-based tooling,
          called the Apache UIMA Ruta Workbench, was created to support the
          user and to facilitate every step when writing rules. Both
          the rule language and the workbench integrate
          smoothly with Apache UIMA. 
        </p>
        <p>Major Changes in this Release</p>
        <p>
        <p>UIMA Ruta Language and Analysis Engine:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Depends on UIMA 2.9.0 and uimaFIT 2.2.0</li>
          <li>New block FOREACH: iterate over pattern and reuse the matched annotation in contained rules</li>
          <li>Label expressions across inlined rules are supported, behave like local variables now</li>
          <li>Feature expressions on label expressions are supported</li>
          <li>Setting values of variables by configuration parameter</li>
          <li>Macros support variables</li>
          <li>New type function: typeFromString</li>
          <li>Wordlist initialization with string expressions: simplified specification of language-dependent dictionary usage</li>
          <li>New maven archetype for typical UIMA Ruta projects</li>
          <li>Improved and faster maven plugins</li>
          <li>Parameters additionalScripts and additionalEngines are now optional</li>
          <li>Removed engine loader concept and parameter completely</li>
          <li>Removed redundant Document type</li>
          <li>Improved datapath support</li>
          <li>Improved resource manager support</li>
          <li>Many bug fixes and improvements</li>
         </ul>
        <p>UIMA Ruta Workbench:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Improved support of classpath-lookup in maven-based projects</li>
          <li>Launch configuration supports various serialization formats (with preference)</li>
          <li>Bug fixes</li>
         </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          This release requires an update of script projects and its descriptors in the UIMA Ruta Workbench. 
          There are several ways to achieve this. The recommended way is to right-click on the UIMA Ruta project and select "UIMA Ruta -> Convert to UIMA Ruta project", which will update all provided descriptors.
          Then, select the project and press "Project -> Clean..." in the menu, which will regenerate all descriptors of your scripts based on the new templates.
          Projects built with the UIMA Ruta Maven Plugin require no manual effort.
        </p>

      <p>The UIMA core Java SDK adds some new capabilities and fixes some bugs.
      <ul>
					<li>Two new features were added.
					<ul><li>CasIOUtls - a collection of general-purpose CAS load/save utilities, with support for
					including the type system and index definition information along with the Feature Structures.</li>
					<li>A new set of APIs allowing use of the external shared settings files to be used directly, rather than only by 
					overriding UIMA configuration parameters. These APIs give direct access by the external settings file's key names to the 
					key values.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Many bugs were fixed, including:
					<ul>
					<li>A regression (since version 2.8.0) which broke the unambiguous AnnotationIndex iterator in some cases.</li>
					<li>fixes for the Eclipse tooling plugins to work with the latest Eclipse (4.6, Neon) version.</li>
					<li>Sofa mapping support for flow controllers.</li>
					<li>Fixing a stack overflow error in AnnotationViewer when switching Sofas.</li>
					<li>Fixing 2 JSON serialization issues: mishandling of arrays of FeatureStructures having null entries,

 <p>DUCC stands for Distributed UIMA Cluster Computing. DUCC is a cluster management system providing tooling,
management, and scheduling facilities to automate the scale-out of applications written to the UIMA framework.
Core UIMA provides a generalized framework for applications that process unstructured information such as human
language, but does not provide a scale-out mechanism. UIMA-AS provides a scale-out mechanism to distribute UIMA
pipelines over a cluster of computing resources, but does not provide job or cluster management of the resources.
DUCC defines a formal job model that closely maps to a standard UIMA pipeline. Around this job model DUCC
provides cluster management services to automate the scale-out of UIMA pipelines over computing clusters.

        <p>Note: this version has been replaced by 2.8.1 (above), and has been removed
        from the download page (but is available on the archives, if needed).</p>
	      <p>This release is a bug fix release, plus one enhancement.  The version number incremented because
	      we restored some APIs that were accidentally dropped in 2.7.0.  
	      </p>
	      <p>An improvement was made to the performance of iterators over sorted indexes, such as the 
	      built-in Annotation index.  This improvement may be significant when iterating over types where the type has
	      many subtypes.</p>
	      
	      <p>Index usage by iterators in this situation is now monitored, and when it is determined 
	      that a particular index is no longer being updated and is experiencing poor performance due to merging of 
	      subindexes for the subtypes being iterated over, a one-time conversion of this index to a "flattened" version is done; 
	      the flattened form incurs the cost of merging subindexes once, and for subsequent uses, 
	      iteration overhead is reduced. Any update that affects this flattened index will cause it to be discarded 
        and not used for subsequent iterations.</p>
	      
	      <p>Performance improvement may be seen for use cases 
	      where one annotator creates and indexes instances of a type and its subtypes, and subsequent annotators 
	      read and perhaps update these, but don't add or remove entries of this type/subtypes from the index.

Core UIMA provides a generalized framework for applications that process unstructured information such as human
language, but does not provide a scale-out mechanism. UIMA-AS provides a scale-out mechanism to distribute UIMA
pipelines over a cluster of computing resources, but does not provide job or cluster management of the resources.
DUCC defines a formal job model that closely maps to a standard UIMA pipeline. Around this job model DUCC
provides cluster management services to automate the scale-out of UIMA pipelines over computing clusters.

        <p>Apache uimaFIT&#0153; is a library that 
          facilitates the building of Apache UIMA components, the programmatic use of Apache UIMA
          analysis pipelines, and their testing.

          uimaFIT employs Java annotations to integrate UIMA meta data directly into the source 
          code, allowing for less lines of code and better refactorability then traditional, XML 
          descriptor-based UIMA projects. It is capable of automatically detecting meta data,
          e.g. type system information, from the classpath. Convenience methods are provided for 
          constructing components, pipelines, and for accessing annotations.
          </p>
          
          <p>This is the first Apache release of the project previously known simply as "uimaFIT".</p>
          
          <p>The major changes in this release are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Migration to Apache Foundation as part of the Apache UIMA project.</li>
            <li>New Maven coordinates (groupId: org.apache.uima; artifactId: uimafit-core)</li>
            <li>New uimaFIT Maven plugin for automatically generating uimaFIT meta data in component
              classes and UIMA descriptors from uimaFIT-annotated component classes</li>
            <li>New module for backwards compatibility with uimaFIT 1.4.x-based components</li>
            <li>Consolidated documentation in HTML and PDF format</li>
            <li>Moved CPE support to separate dependency 
              (groupId: org.apache.uima; artifactId: uimafit-cpe)</li>
            <li>Improved component life-cycle handling</li>
            <li>New support for setting multi-valued parameters with simple single 
              values (no need to wrap them in a collection or array anymore)</li>
            <li>Improved support for external resources, including support for
              multi-valued external resources</li>  
          </ul>

		<p>Note on compatibility and migration: Apache uimaFIT 2.0.0 is not a drop-in replacement 
		  for uimaFIT 1.4.x, although, it was tried to keep the migration effort minimal. Please 
          refer to the <a href="d/uimafit-2.0.0/tools.uimafit.book.html#d5e617">

      <subsection name="10 December 2010" date = "10 December 2010" title="Apache UIMA Java SDK 2.3.1 released">
          <p>This release only has the Apache UIMA&#0153; Java SDK, and does not yet have the other
          components.  It is backwards compatible with previous releases, except
          that Java 5 is now the minimum Java level required.</p>
          
        <p>
          This is the first release as a top level project.  
          Not many changes are in this release; included are 
          some fixes for edge cases involving Results Specification,
          a performance fix for the Component Descriptor Editor editing things having
          remote components, and several improvements to the CAS editor. 
          Please see the release notes on the <a href="downloads.cgi">downloads</a> page, for a more complete summary
          and a complete list of changes.

      <subsection name="18 March 2010" date="18 March 2010" title="Apache UIMA graduates from the incubator">
        <p>
          At the ASF board meeting held on 17 March 2010, the Board unanimously approved the proposed resolution to 
          establish the Apache UIMA Project as a top level Apache project.  This signals the successful completion 
          of the incubation process and the beginning of the next phase of Apache UIMA existence.    
        </p>
        <p>
          Becoming a top level project entails setting up some new infrastructure, and moving things. 
          It will take some time to accomplish this move; in the meanwhile, we'll be keeping this website up to date.

      <subsection name='26 January 2010' date="26 January 2010" title="UIMA 2.3.0-incubating Released">
        <p>
          This release includes all 4 major components: 
          the UIMA Java SDK, UIMACPP, UIMA-AS (Asynchronous Scalout capability), 
          and a growing set of UIMA Addons.  It is backwards compatable with previous releases, except
          that Java 5 is now the minimum Java level required.</p>
          
          <p>
          The add-ons package contains many new components and annotators.  
          The UIMA-AS (Asynchronous Scaleout)
          framework is extensively enhanced with much more support for error/failure recovery, driven by feedback
          from actual use in several large scale deployments.  The base framework now supports Java 5 generics, and
          is enhanced to make it even more
          light-weight and efficient; for example, it now supports a new network serialization format  
          for communicating with remote
          annotators using a "delta-CAS" - limiting the response sent to just those items which have changed.
