    <section name="Project Management Committee Bylaws">
      <p>
        The Project Management Committee (PMC) has not yet been formed.
        It will be formed when and if the project graduates from the
        Incubator.   </p>
        <!-- was formed by the Apache Board
        on 17 July 2002.  The bylaws were last amended on 6 October 2004.
        There is no preset number of seats on the PMC.  The PMC will strive to
        add every committer within DB that, in the opinion of the PMC as 
        determined by a vote, displays the capability and desire to help guide 
        the DB project. The PMC will nominate a chairperson from amongst their 
        ranks for presentation to the Board. The list of current members can be found in our
        <a href="./whoweare.html"> Project Credits</a>.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Roles">
        <p>
          The PMC is responsible for the strategic direction
          and success of the DB Project. This governing body is expected to
          ensure the project's welfare and guide its overall direction. The PMC
          may not necessarily participate in the day-to-day coding but is
          involved in the overall development plans, the alleviation of any
          bottlenecks, the resolution of conflicts, and the overall technical
          success of the project.
        </p>

        <p>
          The PMC is answerable to the Apache Board with its Chairman serving as
          primary liaison.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Meetings">
        <p>The PMC discusses issues and determines strategic direction via mail
           list.  All binding votes happen on the PMC list.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Membership">
        <p>
          PMC members may resign at any time. A committer will remain on the DB 
          PMC until removed by desire of the committer, action of the board, or
          vote by the PMC.  The Chairman may resign as Chairman at any time 
          without resigning membership to the PMC. The chairperson will serve 
          until voluntary resignation, action of the board, or vote by the PMC.
          The Chairman or any member may be removed from the PMC by a 3/4
          vote of the PMC.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to be elected to the PMC, a person must have served as a
          <a href="roles.html">Committer</a> and be
          nominated by a PMC Member. The nominee must receive 3/4 positive vote
          with a minimum of 3 positive votes.  Abstaining PMC voters do not 
          affect the result.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Creation of Subprojects">
        <p>
          PMC members may propose the creation of new subprojects. Creation of 
          a new subproject requires approval by 3/4 positve vote with a minimum
          of 3 positive votes of the PMC.  Abstaining PMC voters do not 
          affect the result.  New code enters the DB project in accordance with
          ASF policy.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Voting">
        <p>The call for a vote on issues not detailed here may specify 
        requirements for passage. The minimum and default requirement for a 
        passing vote is simple majority of PMC members casting ballots.
        The default voting period is 10 days and the minimum is 7 days unless
        the success or failure is arithmetically known.
