      <p>Apache UIMA&#0153; is an Apache-licensed open source implementation of the
        <i>UIMA specification</i> being developed concurrently by a technical committee (TC) within
        <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OASIS</a>, a standards organization. We encourage UIMA
        developers to become familiar with the UIMA specification by visiting the following links.</p>
        
      <p> In March, 2009, OASIS 
          members approved the 
          Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) version 1.0 specification
          as an OASIS Standard, a status that signifies the highest level of ratification. 
       See <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/news/oasis-news-2009-03-19.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        https://www.oasis-open.org/news/oasis-news-2009-03-19.php</a> for details.
