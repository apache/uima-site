      <p>
        Welcome to the Apache UIMA&#0153; project. Our goal is to support a thriving community of users and
        developers of UIMA frameworks, tools, and annotators,        
        facilitating the analysis of unstructured content such as text, audio and
        video.
      </p>

      <h2>What is UIMA?</h2>
      
       <p>
        Unstructured Information Management applications are
        software systems that analyze large volumes of
        unstructured information in order to discover knowledge
        that is relevant to an end user. An example UIM
        application might ingest plain text and identify
        entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or
        relations, such as works-for or located-at.
      </p>

      <img style="float: right;" src="./images/UimaIs.png" width="430" alt="UIMA is made of many things" />     

      <p>UIMA enables applications to be decomposed into components,
        for example "language identification" =&gt; "language
        specific segmentation" =&gt; "sentence boundary
        detection" =&gt; "entity detection (person/place names
        etc.)".  Each component implements interfaces defined
        by the framework and provides self-describing
        metadata via XML descriptor files. The framework manages
        these components and the data flow between them.
        Components are written in Java or C++; the data that
        flows between components is designed for efficient
        mapping between these languages.
      </p>
      
      <p>UIMA additionally
        provides capabilities to wrap components as network
        services, and can scale to very large volumes by
        replicating processing pipelines over a cluster of
        networked nodes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Apache UIMA is an Apache-licensed open source
        implementation of the 
        UIMA specification <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/28492/uima-spec-wd-05.pdf">[pdf]</a>
        <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/28491/uima-spec-wd-05.doc">[doc]</a> (that
        specification is, in turn, being developed concurrently
        by a technical committee within
        <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=uima">OASIS</a>
        , a standards organization). We invite and encourage you
        to participate in both the implementation and
        specification efforts.
      </p>
      
      <p class="nobottomspace">Here you can find:</p>
      <ul class="noverticalspace">

      </p>
      
      <p>
        The <a href="doc-uima-why.html">Frameworks</a> run the components, and are available for both Java and
        C++.  The 
        <a href="doc-uima-examples.html">Java Framework</a> supports running both Java and non-Java
        components (using the C++ framework).  The 
        <a href="doc-uimacpp-huh.html">C++ framework</a>, besides
        supporting annotators written in C/C++, also supports Perl, Python, and 
        TCL annotators. The <a href="doc-uimaas-what.html">UIMA-AS</a> and 
    <a href="doc-uimaducc-whatitam.html">UIMA-DUCC</a> are both Scaleout Frameworks and are 
    addons to the base Java framework. The UIMA-AS supports very flexible scaleout 
    capability based on JMS (Java Messaging Services) and ActiveMQ. The UIMA-DUCC extends UIMA-AS
        by providing cluster management services to automate the scale-out of UIMA pipelines over 
    computing clusters.

    itself.
      </p>
        
      <p>The frameworks support configuring and running pipelines of
        Annotator components.  These components do the actual work
        of analyzing the unstructured information.  Users can <a href="doc-uima-annotator.html">write
        their own annotators</a>, or configure and use pre-existing 
        annotators.  Some annotators are <a href="sandbox.html#uima-addons-annotators">available as part of this project</a>;
        others are contained in <a href="external-resources.html">various repositories</a> on the internet.
        GitHub.com lists over

           href="https://github.com/apache/uima-uimaj/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS0xNzk4MzkxNTI%3D">900 repositories</a> that have dependencies on 
           the UIMA Java SDK core.
      </p>
      
      <p>In 2018, the internals of the UIMA Java framework were redesigned for a tighter integration with Java 
         including for example, 
         <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"
            href="https://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-current/version_3_users_guide.html#uv3.select.terminal_form_actions.streams">Java Streams</a>
         support for working with annotations, and for 
         supporting higher performance on modern processors with memory caches.  This is available as Version 3.x.x
         of the UIMA Java SDK, and associated components.  Version 2 continues to be supported, but new work should
         use version 3.  </p>
      
      <p>An extensive rule-based scripting language
        (<a href="ruta.html">RUTA</a>), an associated analysis engine built on top of UIMA, and an Eclipse-based tooling workbench for interactively
        developing and testing the rules, is part of this project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additional infrastructure support components include a <a href="sandbox.html#simple-server">simple
        server</a> that can receive REST requests and return annotation results,
        for use by other web services.
      </p>
      
      <p>The <a href="sandbox.html">Addons and Sandbox</a> is for Addons (Annotators and other things) for UIMA, and
        a place where new ideas are developed for potential incorporation into the project.
