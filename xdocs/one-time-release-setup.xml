<section name="One time setup instructions for releasing Apache UIMA">
  <p>
    Here you will find information on how to set up various tools 
    and configurations needed when releasing Apache UIMA artifacts.
  </p>
  
  <p>First, be sure you've done the general
    <a href="one-time-setup.html">one-time-setup</a>.    
  </p>
  
  <p>The rest of the setup is taken from various other sources around Apache
    (links below).</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b><code>Settings.xml</code></b> file:
      <p>Create and/or update your Maven settings.xml file (located where your local repo is).
        Follow <a target="_blank" 
          href="http://maven.apache.org/developers/committer-settings.html">these instructions</a> (but
          ignore the last line about needing to be a member of group <code>apcvs</code> and <code>maven</code>).
        Use Maven's <a target="_blank" href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html">
          password encryption capabilities</a> to encrypt your LDAP password, used to log on to
          the server for uploading things to the Apache Nexus Repositories (both SNAPSHOTs and Staging).
      </p>
      <p>Your settings file should <b>not</b> contain your GPG passphrase, to avoid the security
         risk inherent in having this in a file stored on your machine.  Instead, it should have lines
        like these:
<pre>
  &lt;gpg.useagent>true&lt;/gpg.useagent>
  &lt;!--gpg.passphrase>&lt;/gpg.passphrase-->  &lt;!-- don't put passphrase in file -->
</pre>        
        </p>
        <p>These lines go in your settings.xml file, inside a &lt;profile> that is active when the signing is needed 
        (you can just make it active always, too), inside a &lt;properties> element, like so:
<pre>&lt;properties>
  &lt;gpg.useagent>true&lt;/gpg.useagent>
  ...
&lt;/properties></pre>
        </p>
    <p>Here is a sample settings.xml profile:
<pre>&lt;settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
                      http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
  &lt;profiles>
    &lt;profile>
      &lt;id>local-build-configuration&lt;/id>
      &lt;!-- Use &lt;activeProfiles>&lt;activeProfile>local-build-configuration&lt;/activeProfile>&lt;/activeProfiles>
                         outside of the &lt;profile> element. See example at bottom.
            
      &lt;properties>
        &lt;uima-maven-build-eclipse-home>C:/p/eclipse/3.5/eclipse&lt;/uima-maven-build-eclipse-home>
        &lt;uimaWebsiteDistributionUrl>file:///c:/a/uimaWebsite/&lt;/uimaWebsiteDistributionUrl>
        &lt;gpg.useagent>true&lt;/gpg.useagent>
      &lt;/properties>
    &lt;/profile>
  
  &lt;/profiles>
  
  &lt;!-- activeProfiles - a list of profiles that are active for all builds -->
  &lt;activeProfiles>
    &lt;activeProfile>local-build-configuration&lt;/activeProfile>
  &lt;/activeProfiles>
&lt;/settings></pre>    
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Create (if you haven't already) your GPG keys; see 
        <a target="_blank" 
          href="http://maven.apache.org/developers/release/pmc-gpg-keys.html">Making GPG Keys</a>.  
    </li>
    <li>You need to have a recent GPG client installed.  See 
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnupg.org/">http://www.gnupg.org/</a>.
      The recent ones support the agents needed to have the capability of popping up 
      (via an installed service) a window when
      the passphrase is needed - so you never need to put the passphrase into a file.
      I've found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gpg4win.org/">http://www.gpg4win.org/</a>
      has the agent support, for Windows XP.
    </li>
    <li>
      You need a current version of the SVN client, Subversion (1.6) installed and on your shell's path. 
    See <a target="_blank" href="http://subversion.apache.org/">http://subversion.apache.org/</a>
    At least one person has had success using the client from <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.collab.net/downloads/subversion/">Collabnet</a> on Windows.
    </li>
    <li>You need Java 1.5.  (Our builds should be done with 1.5 to catch any accidental use of 1.6-only 
      methods).</li>
    <li>Set the environmental variable <code>MAVEN_OPTS</code> to "-Xmx800m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m" 
    (these may be too large, but they currently work).</li>
    <li>Download and install Maven 3.0-beta-1 (or later), and set it up to be on the PATH.</li>
  </ul>
