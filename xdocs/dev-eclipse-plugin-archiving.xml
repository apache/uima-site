<title>Archiving Eclipse Plugins</title>

<section name="Overview">
<p>The Eclipse Update Site holds a multi-update-site root, which, in turn, links to various subsites (for various projects).
  Each of those subsites typically has several versions of the plugins; a release process adds fresh versions of plugins to that site.
</p>

<p>At some point, there are too many versions, and it makes sense to archive these older ones.  
  This requires updating metadata objects, which in turn requires running special tooling.
</p>
</section>

<section name="Goals for archiving">
  <p>An archive approach would, ideally, have these properties</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce the number of choices during the Eclipse install menus to just the more recent ones</li>
    <li>Support an older "archive" site where older version could be obtained if needed, without loading the Apache Mirror system.</li>
    <li>Have a simple mechanism for archiving older releases</li>
  </ul>

<section name="Tools for archiving">
  <p>The only tool I've found for removing releases from a p2 repository (update subsite) is documented here:
  https://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Fguide%2Fp2_repositorytasks.htm .
  It's an eclipse ant task.  These need to be run using the special eclipse ant task runner.  This is documented here:
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2327393/running-p2-ant-tasks-outside-eclipse.
