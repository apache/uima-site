<title>Archiving Eclipse Plugins</title>

<section name="Overview">
<p>The Eclipse Update Site holds a multi-update-site root, which, in turn, links to various subsites (for various projects).
  Each of those subsites typically has several versions of the plugins; a release process adds fresh versions of plugins to that site.
</p>

<p>At some point, there are too many versions, and it makes sense to archive these older ones.
</p>

</section>

<section name="Goals for archiving">
  <p>An archive approach would, ideally, have these properties</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce the number of choices during the Eclipse install menus to just the more recent ones</li>
    <li>Support an older "archive" site where older version could be obtained if needed, without loading the Apache Mirror system.</li>
    <li>Have a simple mechanism for archiving older releases</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section name="Strategy for archiving">
  <p>The basic strategy is to have multiple update sites:
  <ul><li>A more-or-less current one, which has the most recent plugins, plus perhaps a few of the older releases</li>
      <li>Older plugin site(s) (not too many) which contain ranges of plugins</li>
  </ul>  
  </p>
  
  <p>A typical imagined timeline would be
    <ul>
      <li>A subsite is started (e.g. ruta, or uimaj)</li>
      <li>Releases occur, and plugins are added at some version level</li>
      <li>After some number of releases, a decision is made that the repo is getting too big.</li>
        
      <li>The old repo is renamed with a suffix indicating the range of versions in it.  For example,
         the "uimaj" repo might have a name uimaj-2.3.1-2.10.1.</li>
      <li>A new repo is created, with just one (the latest version), and is deployed. 
        A one-time update to the site
        documentation is made to indicate where to find older eclipse plugins (the Apache archive site, following the
        the naming conventions: uima/eclipse-update-site/---subsitename-x.x.x-y.y.y).</li> 
      <li>After confirming that the renamed old site is visible in Archive, then it is deleted on the main release site.</li>  
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>After this is done, the new subsite will have just the latest version in it, 
  and would then be added to over time, with additional
     releases.  When it gets too big, the same procedure is repeated, with a new named update site .../---subsitename.u.u.u-v.v.v
     with another range set being created and archived.</p>
     
</section>

<section name="Resetting the update site for a new batch of versions">
  <!-- 
  <p>The eclipse ant tasks for maintaining update sites are documented here:
  https://help.eclipse.org/oxygen/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Fguide%2Fp2_repositorytasks.htm .
  </p>
  
  <p>This ant task is used in a Maven project, located in uima/build, named: 
    <a target="_blank" href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/uima/build/trunk/uima-eclipse-update-site-slicing/">
    uima-eclipse-update-site-slicing</a>.
    This does the slicing described above.  To use, check out this project as a maven project (it's not a Java project), and 
    read the readme.txt, and follow the instructions.</p>
    
  <p>When it runs, it reads the existing subsite directly from the dist.apache.org repository, and builds the request slice
    in the project's target/eclipse-update-site/- - -subsite- - - directory.</p>
    
  <p>To complete the maintenance, do these steps in the dist.apache.org svn release eclipse-update-site:
    <ol>
      <li>Do a sanity test of the new subsite - try installing it into a fresh Eclipse install.</li>
      <li>svn mv  to rename the current subsite to the versioned name.</li>
      <li>once it appears on the archive spot, do an svn delete to remove it </li>
      <li>import the new (pruned) subsite to the release spot.</li>
    </ol></p>
    -->
  <p>Here is the procedure to reset the update site for a new batch of versions, going forward.   
  <ul>
    <li>Rename the existing update site with a suffix indicating the range of versions.  For 
        example, uimaj would be renamed to uimaj-2.3.1-2.10.1 </li>
    <li>generate the new site using a version of the update site pom which skips the steps
        that copy the previous site.  This results in the new update site only having the
        current version.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  After the rename has been copied to https://archive.apache.org/dist/uima/eclipse-update-site/xxxx-a.b.c-d.e.f
  delete this from the main distribution site.
</p>
<p>Do the renaming then deleting using svn repository commands run against the dist.apache.org svn site.  SVN doesn't have a rename command, so
  use a copy then delete of the old one.  You can also use a GUI like TortiseSvn.
