<title>Signing Eclipse Plugins - release process</title>
<author email="dev@uima.apache.org">

<body>
<section name="Overview">
<p>All released Apache artifacts are normally signed.  Eclipse plugin jar signing is in addition 
to the Apache release signing.  This additional signing (with a recognized authority certificate)
allows the plugin installer to avoid saying it is installing unsigned artifacts, and needs permission to continue.
</p>

<p>Only the plugin JARs need to be signed (to be confirmed) - that is, the Feature JARs are not signed.</p>

  <subsection name="Process Flow">
    <p>We use a 2 step process, to reduce costs to Apache for signing release candidates which subsequently fail.
       After the release vote passes, plugin Jar files are manually uploaded and signed, 
       and then a subsequent Ant task is run to rebuild the site packaging artifacts.</p>
       
    <p>The first step is to do a normal build of the update site, using mvn release:prepare.
       This produces the artifacts for voting on, without signing the
       new plugin Jars, and writes the "tag" for this into SVN for record keeping.</p>
     
     <p>After the vote passes 
        the release manager, using their special credentials, logs onto the signing portal, and makes a signing set
       consisting of all of the Jars in target/eus-work/plugins (not the *.pack.gz files), and signs them.  The signed Jars are down-loaded into 
       a new directory, target/eus-work-signed/plugins/. </p>
       
     <p>Now the finish-after-signing ant build is run.  This task does all the remaining steps, starting with the -pack 
        step, regenerating the *.pack.gz files in the eus-work-signed/plugins directory, and adding the various
        signatures and checksums to these.  These are then re-merged with any previous contents of the update site,
        and re-published.</p>
        
     <p>Please try installing the result to confirm nothing went wrong in this re-build process.</p>
       
  </subsection>
  <subsection name="Changes to Normal Build">
    <p>To support signing, the normal build needs 2 small changes.
      <ol>
        <li>(actually a bug fix) The existing build after running the JarProcessor, copies the original (unprocessed) Jars
            into the eus-work/plugins - accidentally overwriting the repacked/conditioned Jars.  This step should be deleted;
            it is unnecessary.
        </li>
        <li>When doing the subsite build, any previous versions are combined with the new version.  This is done by 
            downloading the previous versions into a new instance of the subsite.  Because this packaging step needs
            to be redone, the original contents.jar and artifacts.jar files need to be saved so they can be restored
            before the rebuild with signed artifacts.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

<section name="Release Manager needs to have a valid code signing certificate">
  <p>
    For the UIMA project, contact the PMC chair for aid in obtaining a code signing certificate if you need one.</p>
</section>

<section name="Release only if 1 or more changed Eclipse plugins">
  <p>If the release does not have any updates to Eclipse Plugin JARs, save Apache money by reusing previously released versions.
     If the release has 1 or more JARs, these will be signed in 1 signing event. so it doesn't matter how many Jars there are.</p>
