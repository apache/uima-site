<title>Signing Eclipse Plugins - release process</title>

<section name="Overview">
<p>All released Apache artifacts are normally signed.  This signing is different from Eclipse Plugin JAR signing.
If Eclipse Plugin JARs are not signed with a recognized authority certificate, when you install the plugin, the
Eclipse installer says you are installing unsigned artifacts, and needs permission to continue.
</p>

<p>This page describes how the Eclipse plugin release process is set up for JAR signing.</p>
</section>

<section name="Release Manager needs to have a valid code signing certificate">
  <p>
    For the UIMA project, contact the PMC chair for aid in obtaining a code signing certificate if you need one.</p>
</section>

<section name="Release only if 1 or more changed Eclipse plugins">
  <p>If the release does not have any updates to Eclipse Plugin JARs, save Apache money by reusing previously released versions.
     If the release has 1 or more JARs, these will be signed in 1 signing event. so it doesn't matter how many Jars there are.</p>
