<section name="Overview">
<p>All released Apache artifacts are normally signed.  This signing is different from Eclipse Plugin JAR signing.
If Eclipse Plugin JARs are not signed with a recognized authority certificate, when you install the plugin, the
Eclipse installer says you are installing unsigned artifacts, and needs permission to continue.
</p>

<p>This page describes how the Eclipse plugin release process is set up for JAR signing.</p>
