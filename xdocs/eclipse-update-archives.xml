<p>
The Apache UIMA&#0153; project keeps older versions of Eclipse Update Sites
in the Apache archive.  These are organized by subsites:
<ul>
  <li>uimaj - for the core UIMA Java project</li>
  <li>others - to be added when the archive is created.</li>
  <!--  
  <li>ruta - for the Ruta project</li>
  <li>uima-as - for the UIMA Asynchronous Scaleout project</li>
   -->
</ul>
</p>
 
<p>The naming convention is to start with the subsite's main name such as uimaj or ruta,
and then suffix this with "-a.b.c-d.e.f" where a.b.c represents the earliest version
and d.e.f is the last version included.
