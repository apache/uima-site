  <section name="Demo: Apache UIMA DUCC">
   <p>
   	DUCC stands for Distributed UIMA Cluster Computing. 
	DUCC is a cluster management system providing tooling, management, 
	and scheduling facilities to automate the scale-out of applications 
	written to the UIMA framework. 
   </p>
   <p>
   <i style="color:#009900;">
	Core UIMA
	</i>
	provides a generalized framework for applications that 
	process unstructured information such as human language, 
	but does not provide a scale-out mechanism. 
	<i style="color:#009900;">
	UIMA-AS
	</i>
	provides a scale-out mechanism to distribute UIMA pipelines 
	over a cluster of computing resources, but does not provide job or 
	cluster management of the resources. 
	<i style="color:#009900;">
	UIMA-DUCC 
	</i>
	defines a formal job 
	model that closely maps to a standard UIMA pipeline. Around this 
	job model DUCC provides cluster management services to automate the 
	scale-out of UIMA pipelines over computing clusters.
   </p>

   <p>
   <i style="color:#009900;">
	ducc-mon
	</i>
	stands for Distributed UIMA Cluster Computing Monitor. 
	It comprises a web server that is meant to display information about 
	the running DUCC including: user Jobs, user Reservations, user 
	Services and the DUCC System itself.

   <p>
   The 
	<i style="color:#009900;">
	demo
	</i>
	comprises a DUCC installation within the apache.org domain. 
	A computing cluster has been configured and started, and a continually 
	running driver simulates user work submissions.
