<subsection name="OpenNLP Project">

<p>The <a href="http://www.opennlp.org">OpenNLP Project</a> provides the
official UIMA integration for the OpenNLP Sentence Detector, Tokenizer, POS Tagger,
Name Finder, Document Categorizer, Chunker and Parser. 
The opennlp.uima distribution can be downloaded from the projects
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/opennlp/files/OpenNLP%20Tools/">download page</a> 
and includes a sample PEAR which can easily be tested with the Cas Visual Debugger.

<subsection name="UIMA Component Repository at CMU">

<p> The <a href="http://uima.lti.cs.cmu.edu/">UIMA Component Repository at CMU</a> lists
a large number of UIMA components, some of which can be freely downloaded.

<subsection name="JULIE Lab NLP Toolsuite">
<p>The <a href="http://www.julielab.de/content/view/117/174/">JULIE Lab NLP Toolsuite</a>
consists of a collection of NLP components, some of which are provided as freely available
UIMA components.  There is also a useful <a href="http://www.julielab.de/content/view/120/176/">
type system</a> you can use as basis for your own NLP applications.

<subsection name="u-compare.org">
  <p>
    <a href="http://u-compare.org/"><b>u-compare.org</b></a> provides 
    a web-based integrated platform for the purpose of       
    sharing and comparing UIMA components and tools, including visualizers and
utilities, and includes a large set of type-system-compatible UIMA components.

The site is jointly run by three organizations; each of these organizations also
supports various UIMA components.  The organizations and links to their
repositories are:
  </p>
<ul>
  <li>the <a href="http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/">
  Tsujii Laboratory</a> at the University of Tokyo; <a href="http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/uima/">repository</a>.
  </li>
