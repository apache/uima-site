<p>

Here are some links to Apache UIMA&#0153; components available from other places.  If you find other links that

you think should be listed here, please drop us a line on on uima-dev or uima-user.  Similarly,

if any of the content is out of date or inappropriate, please let us know.

<subsection name="OpenNLP Project">

<p>The <a href="http://www.opennlp.org">OpenNLP Project</a> provides the
official UIMA integration for the OpenNLP Sentence Detector, Tokenizer, POS Tagger,
Name Finder, Document Categorizer, Chunker and Parser. 
The opennlp.uima distribution can be downloaded from the projects
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/opennlp/files/OpenNLP%20Tools/">download page</a> 
and includes a sample PEAR which can easily be tested with the Cas Visual Debugger.
</p>

  <p>OpenNLP has recently moved to the Apache Software Foundation, and can be found
  in the Apache Incubator, <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/projects/opennlp.html">here</a>.</p>

<subsection name="UIMA Component Repository at CMU">

<p> The <a href="http://uima.lti.cs.cmu.edu/">UIMA Component Repository at CMU</a> lists
a large number of UIMA components, some of which can be freely downloaded.

<subsection name="JULIE Lab NLP Toolsuite">
<p>The <a href="http://www.julielab.de/content/view/117/174/">JULIE Lab NLP Toolsuite</a>
consists of a collection of NLP components, some of which are provided as freely available
UIMA components.  There is also a useful <a href="http://www.julielab.de/content/view/120/176/">
type system</a> you can use as basis for your own NLP applications.

</subsection>

<subsection name="u-compare.org">
  <p>
    <a href="http://u-compare.org/"><b>u-compare.org</b></a> provides 
    a web-based integrated platform for the purpose of       
    sharing and comparing UIMA components and tools, including visualizers and
utilities, and includes a large set of type-system-compatible UIMA components.

The site is jointly run by three organizations; each of these organizations also
supports various UIMA components.  The organizations and links to their
repositories are:
  </p>
<ul>
  <li>the <a href="http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/">
  Tsujii Laboratory</a> at the University of Tokyo; <a href="http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/uima/">repository</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    the <a href="http://compbio.uchsc.edu/Hunter_lab/">
  Center for Computational Pharmacology</a> at the University of Colorado School of
Medicine; <a href="http://bionlp-uima.sourceforge.net/">repository</a> (see BioNLP entry,
which describes this in more detail).

<subsection name="BioNLP Wrappers">
  <p>The Center for Computational Pharmacology at the University of Colorodo
  has wrapped a number of popular bio-informatic annotators as UIMA components, and
  added some supporting additional code and components.  More information is available 
  at <a href="http://bionlp-uima.sourceforge.net">http://bionlp-uima.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

<subsection name="UIMA French portal">
<p><a href="http://www.uima-fr.org" target="_blank">http://www.uima-fr.org</a>
is a French-speaking web portal
about UIMA. It aims at developing a UIMA French-speaking community by
providing services such as a discussion list, a feed aggregator and a
repository of UIMA NLP resources (some of them being dedicated for
processing French). It is supported by the LINA Lab. at the University
of Nantes.

DKPro Core is a collection of UIMA-based components and 
provides APIs and components of basic pre-processing and NLP 
analysis tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, parsing etc. 
It also provides support for several file formats such as text, 
WSDL, XML, or PDF. Due to licensing issues the project is sub-divided into 
<ul>
