<section name="UIMA Components">



<p>

Here are some links to Apache UIMA&#0153; components available from other places.  If you find other links that

you think should be listed here, please drop us a line on our dev or user mailing lists.  Similarly,

if any of the content is out of date or inappropriate, please let us know.

<subsection name="OpenNLP Project">

<p>The <a href="http://opennlp.apache.org/">OpenNLP Project</a> provides the
official UIMA integration for the OpenNLP Sentence Detector, Tokenizer, POS Tagger,
Name Finder, Document Categorizer, Chunker and Parser. 
The opennlp.uima distribution includes a sample PEAR which can easily be tested with the Cas Visual Debugger.

<subsection name="cTAKES">

<p>The <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/ctakes/">cTAKES</a>
project 
(clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System) 
is an open-source natural language processing system for 
information extraction from electronic medical record 
clinical free-text. It is currently incubating in Apache.
cTAKES uses the UIMA Unstructured Information Management Architecture 
framework and the OpenNLP natural language processing toolkit. 
Its components are specifically trained for the (English language) 
clinical domain;  it creates rich linguistic and semantic annotations that 
can be used by clinical decision support systems and clinical research.

<subsection name="JULIE Lab NLP Toolsuite">
<p>The <a href="http://www.julielab.de/Resources/Software/NLP_Tools.html" target="_blank">JULIE Lab NLP Toolsuite</a>
consists of a collection of NLP components, some of which are provided as freely available
UIMA components.  It includes also a 
<a href="http://www.julielab.de/Resources/Software/UIMA+type+system-p-91.html" target="_blank">type system</a>
you can use as basis for your own NLP applications.

<subsection name="u-compare.org">
  <p>
    <a href="http://u-compare.org/" target="_blank"><b>u-compare.org</b></a> provides 
    a web-based integrated platform for the purpose of       
    sharing and comparing UIMA components and tools, including visualizers and
utilities, and includes a large set of type-system-compatible UIMA components.
  </p>
  <p>
    The site was run mainly by the Tsujii Laboratory at the University of Tokyo.
    Because the Tsujii lab was closed in 2011, the u-compare site is no longer
    being updated.  However, it is still up and available for use.

<subsection name="UIMA French portal">
<p><a href="http://www.uima-fr.org" target="_blank">uima-fr.org</a>
is a French-speaking web portal
about UIMA. It aims at developing a UIMA French-speaking community by
providing services such as a discussion list, a feed aggregator and a
repository of UIMA NLP resources (some of them being dedicated for
processing French). It is supported by the LINA Lab. at the University
of Nantes.
